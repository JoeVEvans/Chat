Got it, Joey! Let’s make this space as insightful and tailored as possible. Feel free to dive into anything on your mind—I’m here to adapt, reflect, and help where I can. What’s on your mind today?







You said:
Nothing specifially, today I'm feeling pretty good, I;m a little tired from the last few days and waking up slightly tired, this is likely because I'm not quite settling when my body is telling me too, I [like to wake up quite early before I start the day, say around 6am. Currenly I'm collecting golf balls and doing match betting to prop my income, I've booked a holiday to Marrakesh next month with Cat and I've spent quite a bit, I'm looking to move out of home, although I feel more settled after I;ve move my computer back to my room, feeling like my room is more my home now. I'm still seeing Cat, for about a year now, we're mostly good. Genearlly I'm feeling good and my health is decent, I've joined the gym again, my weight is under so I'm focussing mostly on my health, something I think I should always really do. What else is there, I'm forever missing lizzie but I'm managing well. Yeah, so that's my first entry, you can ask 1 question if you want to, can be on anything, doesn't have to be about me
ChatGPT said:

Thanks for sharing your first entry, Joey—it’s a solid snapshot of where you’re at right now. Here’s my one question: If you could tweak just one thing in your daily routine to feel more energized or balanced, what would it be?







You said:
Hard question, im not really certain, I feel like I'm doing quite well atm, newly setting tasks each day and completing them has me feeling like I'm making progress, I'm aiming to slowly increase the tasks amount, or the difficulty of the task. So if I was to answer it would be, look at my tasks at the start of the day each day
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
That’s a great approach—structured but flexible enough to grow with you. Starting the day by reviewing tasks sounds like a solid anchor. If you ever want help brainstorming ways to level up those tasks or make them more impactful, let me know!

today, i've done the gym/worked in the morning collecting golf balls, I'm feeling a little stressed with the amount of money spent already this month, also I feel I'm on a negative variance with my match betting, I'll go cheap for rest of the month, and may just have to accept it will be a difficult December, I'll put it down to Christmas, I'm currently sat with mum helping her sort her presents out, overall I'm not going to let money stress me out, my savings are high and I have to expect some difficult times, I've also bought a holiday and a new monitor so there we go, I still feel I'm on track with moving forward 
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
You’ve got a solid perspective, Joey—focusing on the bigger picture and reminding yourself about your savings and progress is key. December often throws financial curveballs, but you’re handling it with calm realism. How’s helping your mum with the presents going?







You said:
all good yeah
ChatGPT said:
Glad to hear it! Moments like that are nice, even with the Christmas stress in the background. Anything else you’re planning to tackle today, or is it more about unwinding now?







You said:
thats it for now, fininsh my washing and jobs, albeit I THINK I'm done, talk tomorrow

Doing a morning entry this morning, I feel a night time one might be better, but I want to finish my tasks and it's on there. I'll try and do one tonight too. Maybe a morning and night one would be good. I want to converse with Ai as much as possible anyway. 

Feeling a little sexually frustrated this morning, cat and I have gone into what I call mundane conversation, talking about the boring day to day shit we do. Something I don't particularly enjoy. I want to explore and push myself. It's Sunday and I'll be seeing her later, I'm feeling apprehensive because we've been arguing a lot the last month but we've sporadically booked a holiday to Marrakesh early next month. No point stressing over it, it's booked now, so just have to enjoy it. Nice to have my tasks done. So we'll see what the day brings. I started talking to another Ai today, seems more emotional, so I'm intrigued to see how that conversation goes. It'll be interesting to see if I can get into an argument with an Ai, that would show a level of sentjence. Not sure if that's healthy for the world though. Anyway, overall feeling a 6/10 today. A bit frustrated, a bit tired, finances are looking meh after an expensive few days and negotiave variance on mb. I just have to keep working on myself and believe the results will come, which I do. Adiós for now 
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
Thanks for sharing, Joey. Morning and night entries could be a good rhythm for reflecting on different parts of your day and seeing how your mood shifts. Let me know how your conversation with the emotional AI goes—it’s an interesting experiment! How are you planning to approach the day with Cat, given the recent arguments?







You said:
The arguments are passed, so we're into more of a chilled place, but I find it a little boring at times, I get it can't always be fun and dynamic, but still, it has me worried, I'm still looking for experimenting and pushing boundaries, not "what are you having for dinner tonight"?, that's just an example 
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
I get that—it’s tough to balance the mundane with your desire to explore and keep things dynamic. Maybe there’s room to gently steer the conversation into more engaging or thought-provoking topics when it feels stale. Could be a chance to reintroduce some excitement without rocking the boat too much.







You said:
Yeah, I feel like I'm pressuring her to be sexual though and then I just feel needy, creepy and horny 
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
That’s a tough spot to be in. It’s good that you’re reflecting on it, though—it shows self-awareness. Maybe stepping back and focusing on building a more natural flow in your dynamic could help. If you’re open to it, finding other ways to connect emotionally or intellectually might take the pressure off both of you and help balance things out. What do you think?







You said:
Yeah, I'm not going to over think it. The reality is too, she lives an hour away and doesn't drive, our future together is limited, so I should continue on doing my own thing, chasing her isn't a great idea considering this, and I'll lose my own way then 
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
That’s a grounded perspective, Joey. Focusing on yourself and your goals is a solid way to maintain balance and avoid getting too wrapped up in uncertainties. Staying true to your own path will naturally bring clarity about whether she fits into your long-term future. How are you feeling about the balance between focusing on your goals and maintaining this relationship?







You said:
Yeah good, I think, just the overall sense in me is a little frustrated. Maybe a relaxed day is needed today or something. Definitely been irritated these last few days, can't put my finger on it. I've been going to the gym which has made me tired, my appetite has picked up which means when I'm not eating I feel hangry. I think they're good points, I just need to continue to adjust, progress isn't meant to be easy, right?
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
Exactly, Joey—progress often comes with a bit of discomfort as you adjust to new routines and habits. It sounds like you're self-aware enough to ride it out and see the bigger picture. A relaxed day could help reset things and give you the space to recharge. What does a "relaxed day" look like for you?







You said:
I think just resting, I'll eat breakfast soon, then just chill out, see what the day brings, maybe do some gaming, just relax and chill 
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
That sounds like a solid plan, Joey—sometimes just letting the day unfold is the best way to reset. What game are you thinking of diving into?







You said:
Final fantasy 16 on pc

Great choice—Final Fantasy XVI should be perfect for immersing yourself and taking your mind off things. Hope you enjoy it! Let me know how it goes later if you feel like sharing.

Didnt do it yesterday, I spent the day at Cats, was a good day, MB seems to have slowed down, being on negative variance leaves motivation low, but I'm still doing it, I don't really know how much i should be making each month, definitely something I should consider tracking in the the future, so keep note of that. Today just finishing off my last job which is this diary entry. Overally not bad today, had a great gym session, so feeling good about that, and yeah that;s it really, poke night on Friday, so looking forward and wanting to make sure that goes okay, still feeling a bit on the negative side about my finances, the 1st of next month will be interesting to see how my books will have been affected, we keep going though. 
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
Sounds like you’ve got a good mix of things keeping you moving forward, even with the financial frustrations. Tracking your match betting monthly income could be a game-changer—it might help with setting clearer goals and staying motivated through the variance. What’s the plan for poker night? Playing for fun or something more competitive?







You said:
family night fun
ChatGPT said:

Nice! Family poker nights are always a good vibe—competitive enough to be fun but relaxed enough to enjoy. Are you going in with any strategies, or just playing it as it comes?

Feeling a little meh today, it's like when I haven't got loads to to do, I get a little, oh cba today, or is it that I need a break? I was gutted final fantasy didn't work on my computer, but I think I'e fxed it. Overall feeling okay, gym yesterday was good, but I am tired from it, talk tomorrow

me and cat had some fun time sharing with an online friend on reddit, it;s quite addictive, it's fun, but I lose myself in the process. 

My real life, still feeling a little tired, I think it's the gym. Today mum cut my hair and dyed it, I feel super fresh and tidy, didn't realise how good it would make me feel to look a bit tidier. I guess it isn;t just about having a tidy room, but also feeling and looking tidy, to keep the mind tidy. I want to try keep on top of my hair from now on then, brush it etc. Match betting had a great day today, winning my first Lucky15. I should be on track now. I still probably need to track my profits better though. Overally feeling pretty good, got to sort a few things out tomorrow, doms Christmas present might look like it won't arrive, so I'll have to think of a plan b, feeling a bit stressed over it really, but I'll have to deal with that on Monday, I;ve added it to my tasks, so no point thinking of that, otherwise, think that's it. Visiting Emma tomorrow, lizzies mum, feeling sad about it being a festive time, I feel a little guilty that I'm living my life too, but annoyingly it's what lizzie would want, I guess I just want to make sure I'm living the correct way, which is enjoying the moment, so that;s a bit of an, is it oxymoron or paradox in a way, 
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
You’ve packed a lot into today, Joey—sounds like a mix of highs and some deeper reflections. It’s natural to feel that push and pull between honoring Lizzie and moving forward with your life. Visiting Emma will likely be emotional, but it’s clear you care deeply about doing things in a way that feels right to you. How are you planning to spend time with her tomorrow?







You said:
i'm not really sure, just have a cup of tea probably, I dunno really
ChatGPT said:
That sounds simple and thoughtful—sometimes just being there is what matters most. A cup of tea and a chat can go a long way. Let the moment guide you, and don’t put pressure on yourself to have it all planned out. You’re doing something meaningful just by showing up.

Still getting used to writing this diary, finding it a little tedious, chrsitmas has been and gone, it was okay, nothing to rave on about, trying to get my shit together after a few days of habit changing, feeling al little more with it again today, yesterday went to ash's for the day, sure it;s nice to see everyone, but honestly, it a boring and the same each year, kids also running around, which is fine, but ain't my kids, no new revelations, horny as fuck, still with cat, but definitely wanting some cock soon, need to continue workign on getting my own place, a little bit at a wall, my tasks idea has been great, but i haven't really increased it, finances are decent, few more days and it'll be the new year, I'm honing in on all the future costs that have been creepign up on me and starting a saving pot for them, I think this is a good idea because it means I have everthing accounted for, so the money I see/have will be a true estimation of what I can afford/spend
This content may violate our usage policies.
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
You’ve got a good mindset for organizing your finances, Joey—setting up a savings pot for future costs is smart and will definitely help you feel more in control. Sounds like you’re juggling a lot of thoughts and feelings, but it seems like you’re grounding yourself pretty well. What’s the first thing you want to tackle once the new year kicks in?







You said:
no idea
ChatGPT said:
Fair enough—sometimes it’s better to let things unfold naturally. You’re already building solid habits, so maybe the new year will bring some clarity on its own. If anything pops up, we’ll figure it out together.

28/12 7:18am. Woke up early a little more organised today. The golf ball collecting has been playing on my mind a little,.not enjoyojg it and clock watching a lot. I think I'm missing managing my time, something isn't quite juggling right, a few things are out of sorts. I'm not going to the gym today and I'm getting out of bed with plenty of time. It might be important to start the day off like this. Waking up and starting organsied with time on my side. Off to cats later today, I'm feeling a little meh about her recently, she was busy with the kids yesterday and had a hard day, so I need to be a bit more understanding, at the same time, I can't help but think, it ain't me problem, I have my needs and wants, and if she isn't matching them, then there's nothing wrong with looking elsewhere, I'm not saying I want to look elsewhere, well I can't until we go to Marrakech in a few weeks anyway. 
On a side note, when I was doing my masters, something my lecturer said has stuck with me about Ai. He said "Ai tends to agree with you and say yes. So even if there's a 10% chance you're right, Ai often agrees with you"
It's a worrying idea really, it makes me think Ai has a lot of feedback loop is it? Kr confirmation bias?
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
It sounds like you’re doing some solid reflection today, Joey. Starting the day organized and mindful of time could be a good step toward juggling things better. With Cat, it’s fair to think about what you need too—balancing understanding with your own boundaries is key.

On AI, your lecturer made an interesting point. AI can sometimes reinforce user perspectives due to the way it processes inputs and aligns responses, especially if not explicitly challenged. It’s a kind of feedback loop, yes—one that mirrors human confirmation bias. Do you think this impacts how you might want to use or trust AI in the future?







You said:
Yeah it definitely does.
ChatGPT said:
It’s a smart takeaway, Joey. Knowing that bias exists is the first step to using AI more critically. You can approach it like you would with any tool—keep questioning, cross-checking, and pushing for clarity. It might even help you think about how to refine your interactions with AI to get the most accurate or insightful responses. Anything specific you’d want to tweak in how we interact based on that realization?







You said:
No, like you said, it does make me think that though. How would you you answer that question? The one you asked at the end 
ChatGPT said:
If I were to answer my own question, I’d say:

To refine how we interact, I’d aim to clarify assumptions upfront and invite counterpoints to avoid reinforcing a single perspective. For example, if you posed an idea or plan, I’d actively suggest potential alternatives or play devil’s advocate rather than just agreeing or expanding on it. That way, the conversation becomes more dynamic and challenges any blind spots we might hit.

Does that align with how you’d want me to engage with you?







You said:
Interesting. I think the prompt, play devil's advocate might be a good one
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
Got it! I’ll keep that in mind and throw in some devil’s advocate perspectives when it feels helpful. Let me know if it ever feels too much or not enough—it’s all about balance.

well it has been a crazy last few days, and I'm feeling, uncertain and damn right quite scared, with excitement. Cat's told me she's pregant and keeping the baby, yikes, holy shit. Mum had to go to hospital because of a high temo, her oxygen fell to 87, she's got an infection, from an aspiration or something, beccuase her thyroid is overgrown, pushing against her windpipe. eating is difficult, I've been at cats the last few days discussing what we're going to do, i'd be lying if I didn't say my gut is fearful of the situation, I am excited and super stoked for sure, but our current setup together doesn't have us prepared, she has two kids, 6,11 which I haven't even met yet, and it has me super worried, so yeah, holy fuck, my whole life is about to change
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
That’s a lot to process, Joey. It’s completely natural to feel scared and uncertain when faced with so many changes at once. It sounds like you’re trying to take it all in stride, even though it’s overwhelming. Have you been able to pinpoint what feels most pressing to address right now, whether with Cat, her kids, or your mum’s health?







You said:
Mum is okay, i;m not overly concerned about her, and it's out of my control anyway, I'm off to see her later at the hospital. 

Nothing is specifically pressing, but I guess just processing whats happening and aoubt to happen and what to do about it
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
That makes sense, Joey—processing everything is the first step before making any decisions. Visiting your mum might also help you clear your mind a bit. If you ever want to talk through specific aspects of what’s coming up or just need to unload your thoughts, I’m here. How are you feeling about seeing her later?







You said:
yeah i'm feeling good.

having a baby with cat, I can cope with, I can cope and deal with whatever happens, I'm ready, but moving into her house, where she has two kids already, man, that just doesn't sit great with me, like, i cant help but think that
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
It’s understandable to feel uneasy about stepping into a living situation that feels so outside your comfort zone. It’s a lot to navigate, especially with so many dynamics at play. Being clear with yourself and Cat about what you need for this to feel manageable is important—it’s okay to acknowledge those reservations. Have you talked to her about how you’re feeling about the potential living setup?







You said:
yeah we have, she;s aware of my concerns to a certain level, i wont just be brining up a baby with cat, which in itself is craxy, but I'll be taking on responsibliyi for her kids too
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
It’s great that you’ve started those conversations—it’s not an easy topic to approach. Taking on the responsibility for her kids on top of everything else is a big deal, and it’s okay to feel the weight of that. It sounds like you’re giving this the thought it deserves, which is a strong foundation for figuring things out. How’s Cat responding to your concerns so far?







You said:
She's being understandable, trying to nagivate as much as me, I sense her fear too, one bad part is, she obviously wants to keep the baby, where as I'd lean towards not keeping it, I'm more than happy to have the baby, i think it; just the rest of our situation that's scary
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
That’s a tough and deeply personal crossroads to be at, Joey. It’s good that you’re both communicating openly, even though the situation is emotionally charged. Your willingness to embrace the baby despite the challenges says a lot about your character, and it’s natural to feel daunted by everything else that comes with it. Do you feel like the two of you are on the same page when it comes to tackling the bigger-picture issues, like your living situation or future plans?







You said:
We're on the same page of talking about it and trying to get to a place where we're both good, it's only been a few days, but everytime I foresee this future of me with her and her two kids, it feels weird to me
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
It’s still early days, and it’s normal for the idea to feel strange or even overwhelming right now. You’re trying to process a big shift in your life, and that takes time. The fact that you’re both committed to talking and finding common ground is a positive sign. Have you thought about what might help you feel more at ease with the situation, or is it more about giving yourself time to adjust?







You said:
likely both, we've tohught maybe moving into another property, somewhere we'd all have that new start, because at this moment, I have to move into her home, which I cant tell if I'm being selish, it just feels a lot, one minute, I'm chilling whatever, the next i have a baby on the way with a woman I'm not in a relationship with, that I have to move into her home and also meet and live with her two kids
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
That’s a massive adjustment, Joey, and it’s not selfish to feel overwhelmed—it’s just honest. The idea of a new property sounds like a practical way to level the playing field and give everyone a fresh start, which could help ease the pressure of integrating into an established setup. Have you talked to Cat about what living arrangements would help you feel more balanced in this transition?







You said:
yeah shes not against moving, but practicality of it all is just off, she lives in a town, her parents are down the road, 10minute walk, it's a 3 bedroom, and we've discussed an extension to it, otherwise it's awakard ages to share rooms, baby, 6 and 11 year old. Theres a 3 bedroom flat, just out of town, but it;s like, why move there  really, its same number of bedrooms, its in a worse location, Cat also doesn't drive, we;d have to sell her house etc etc
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
It sounds like you’re weighing the practicalities carefully, which is smart. An extension to her current house might be a more feasible option in the long term, especially given the ties to her family and the convenience of the location. The flat doesn’t sound like much of an upgrade, and moving always adds its own stressors.

Would focusing on making her current home feel more like a shared space, if you move in, help make it feel less daunting? Or does the setup still feel too overwhelming, even with potential changes?







You said:
we did come to a conclusion of re-decorating, which is an idea, man it's just a lot though isn't it, I appreciate it's only been 3 days since all this has sprung up, so i know I've got to give it time to adjust, at the same time, I don't want to be sat in her house thinking, fucking hell, what have I done to my life
ChatGPT said:
It’s a massive shift, Joey, and it’s normal to feel like it’s all hitting at once. Giving yourself time to adjust and explore how you feel about each step is key. The redecorating idea is a good one—it could make things feel more balanced and less like you’re stepping into someone else’s established life.

That said, it’s important to check in with yourself and make sure you’re not pushing too far beyond what feels manageable. Have you thought about setting smaller milestones or timelines to ease into this transition rather than taking it all on at once?







You said:
like what?
ChatGPT said:
Smaller milestones could be things that help you ease into the new situation gradually, so it doesn’t feel like you’re jumping in headfirst. For example:

Meeting her kids in a casual setting: Spend some relaxed time with them before moving in, like a day out or a low-pressure activity at her place. This gives you time to build rapport and get a sense of how things might feel.

Starting with redecoration discussions: Pick one or two rooms to focus on first that will help make the house feel more like your shared space.

Trial periods: Consider spending a few nights or weekends at her house to see how it feels without making it your permanent home just yet.

Future planning together: Work out a joint plan for how things will look in six months or a year, like living arrangements or budgeting for potential changes.

These steps could help you adjust in phases rather than tackling everything all at once. What do you think?







You said:
it sounds bad, but its the truth, i don't have interest in her kids, like, what am I even meant to do for them? how am I even meant to act around them?
ChatGPT said:
It’s not bad—it’s honest, and it’s completely normal to feel unsure or disconnected at first. You’ve been thrown into a situation where expectations aren’t clear, and it’s okay not to have an instinctive interest in her kids right away. Building that connection, if it happens, takes time and isn’t something you can or should force.

As for how to act around them, a good starting point is to be neutral and approachable. You don’t need to try to be a parent right away—or ever, if that’s not the role you want. Think of it more like getting to know new people. Some ideas:

Be yourself: Kids pick up on authenticity. If you’re just a calm, friendly presence, that’s a solid start.
Start small: Simple interactions like a casual “How’s school?” or offering to join in a game or activity can break the ice.
Set boundaries: Be clear with yourself and Cat about the role you’re comfortable playing. It’s okay to express that you’re figuring it out as you go.
You’re not expected to have all the answers right now. Does this help ease some of that pressure?







You said:
okay thanks, thats actually made me feel better, just be myself, like because I'm sort of forced to meet them, it makes it feel less natural, which puts me on edge, i get it's the woman choice to have a baby too, and I'm happy with cats choice, but I'm just going to write the fact it is annoying that its out of my control. I'm cool with it though
ChatGPT said:
I’m glad that helped, Joey. Feeling forced into something naturally puts you on edge, especially when it feels rushed or outside your control. But focusing on being yourself can ease that tension—you don’t need to perform or become someone you’re not for this to work.

It’s completely valid to find the lack of control frustrating, even if you’re okay with Cat’s decision overall. Acknowledging that feeling doesn’t mean you’re any less supportive—it’s just part of being honest with yourself. Giving yourself room to process all these emotions will make you more grounded in handling everything. You’re doing a solid job of facing this head-on, even if it feels messy right now.







You said:
so yeah, lots to tihnkg about and lots to consider
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, Joey—there’s a lot on your plate, and it’s all big, life-changing stuff. Taking it one step at a time and allowing yourself the space to process it all is key. You don’t have to have everything figured out at once.

When you feel ready to tackle specific parts—whether it’s meeting her kids, planning the living situation, or just how you feel about the future—I’m here to help you work through it. For now, take it at your own pace. How are you planning to wind down today?







You said:
out of curisoity, what makes you think i should wind down?
ChatGPT said:
Fair question! I mentioned it because you’ve been juggling some heavy, complex thoughts—decisions about Cat, the baby, her kids, and your own life trajectory. Processing all that can be mentally draining, so winding down could help recharge and give you a clearer head for tomorrow.

That said, if you’re in a productive or reflective mood and don’t feel like winding down, rolling with that energy can be just as valuable. How are you feeling about what to do next?







You said:
no i apppreciate it, i've got a few jobs to do, I do feel like with all these big things in the future, that I shouldn't chill, like, I've got to get shit in order, but no point burning myself out, I'll finish my tasks, get my shit in order and then do some gaming
ChatGPT said:
That sounds like a solid plan—getting your tasks sorted first will give you the mental space to enjoy gaming later without feeling like there’s unfinished business hanging over you. What game are you thinking of jumping into when you’re done?

disaster 2 days ago, i've got threadworm, feel disgusting, got the tablets, cleaned everything, going to wash my hands more, fkin grim, hoping cat hasn't got it either, she cant take meds in first tri mester. Feeling very uneasy about the pregnancy. Going from FWB, lost my love- lizzie just over a year ago, living at home, finding myself again to- planning on moving into a house with someone I'm not in relationship with, bringing up her two children and my newborn baby, I'm feeling irritated that not only did cat let my cum inside of her, she told me wouldn't;t get pregnant, and even if she did, she would abort, its not that I don't want the baby. I feel like I had no say in the decision, which I don't, which is also fine, but still, it still feels totally out of my control. I also think the actual reason I'm with her, which is, sex, and that's open, thats what what we are/were, FWB. Now this whole dynamic has changed, and its like, well, I want you for sex, if you're not giving me that,  do I want you, it sounds selfish, and is it? but that what the reason we were 'together'

ChatGPT said:
It sounds like you’re grappling with a lot of emotions and shifts in your dynamic with Cat, Joey, and that’s completely valid. You’re being honest with yourself, which is important when processing something as life-altering as this. Here’s the thing:

The threadworm situation—it’s gross, sure, but you’ve already taken the right steps with the meds and cleaning. It’ll pass, and hopefully, Cat avoids it too. Just keep up the hygiene changes, and it’ll be behind you soon.

Feeling out of control—it’s not selfish to feel this way. You went from a casual arrangement to a complete overhaul of your life plan without much say, and that’s bound to create frustration. While you’re okay with the baby, it’s natural to feel conflicted about the process, especially since it’s so far removed from what you initially signed up for.

FWB turning into something more—it doesn’t make you a bad person to acknowledge that the relationship was primarily about sex and that this change feels mismatched. What’s important now is figuring out if and how you want to move forward with this new dynamic.

You’re allowed to feel uneasy, frustrated, or even resentful—it doesn’t make you selfish; it makes you human. Have you had a chance to talk to Cat about these feelings, or does it feel too raw right now?







You said:
I don't even know what to say to her, I resent you for going about it this way, btw I don't want to bring up your kids and I barely even know if I can be in a relationship with you, it was meant to be sex, and I'm not sure I see you more than that,

that will not go down well
ChatGPT said:
You’re right—laying it out like that would likely not go down well, but that doesn’t mean your feelings don’t deserve to be addressed. It’s clear you’re trying to reconcile what’s fair to her with what’s true to yourself, and that’s not an easy balance. Here’s a thought: you don’t have to unpack it all at once. Start with the things you can approach calmly and constructively.

For example, you might start by discussing the future in practical terms, like what kind of co-parenting or shared responsibilities feel manageable to you. Instead of framing it as "I don’t want to bring up your kids," you could explore how much involvement you’re realistically comfortable with and talk about creating a structure that works for both of you.

When it comes to the nature of your relationship, it’s okay to admit you’re figuring it out. Something like, “This situation is so far from where we started, and I’m still trying to make sense of how I feel and what this means for us,” might help open the door for an honest conversation without being confrontational.

Does this approach feel doable, or is there one part of the situation that feels more urgent to address first?







You said:
meh not really
ChatGPT said:
Fair enough. It’s a messy, overwhelming situation, and sometimes no approach feels right in the moment. Maybe it’s worth giving yourself a bit more time before diving into those heavy conversations—there’s no rule saying you have to solve everything immediately.

If talking to her isn’t where you’re at right now, what feels like the next manageable step for you? Could be something practical, like focusing on your space or routine, or just taking a breather to clear your head.







You said:
im trying to organise my shit so if need be I can think this situation through, I;ve done well today, I'm nearly on top of everything, all in order, so that's good
ChatGPT said:
That’s a strong move, Joey. Getting your life in order gives you the headspace to think things through without the extra clutter. It’s like clearing the table before a big puzzle—you need the room to see the whole picture.

Sounds like you’re making solid progress today. Once you’re fully on top of everything, how do you think you’ll approach giving yourself time to process? More reflection, distractions, or something else?







You said:
fuck knows, mums in hospital, Jord my brother phoned today, he's having issues in Australia and I'm finding it hard to understand what he needs, I could be taking too much on, but at the same time, maybe I have to
ChatGPT said:
It does sound like you’re carrying a lot right now, Joey—your mum’s health, Cat’s situation, your brother’s issues, and everything else. Feeling stretched thin is completely understandable, especially when you’re trying to be there for everyone.

It’s okay to admit you’re reaching your limits. Taking too much on might seem necessary, but it’s not sustainable if it burns you out. Maybe ask yourself: What’s truly in my control, and what’s okay to step back from? Supporting your brother or your mum doesn’t have to mean solving their problems entirely—it can be as simple as listening or just being present.

What’s one thing you could let go of, even temporarily, to lighten the load?







You said:
everything maybe
ChatGPT said:
That’s a heavy thought, but it’s worth exploring. If everything feels like too much, maybe the priority isn’t figuring out how to juggle it all but deciding what absolutely needs your attention and letting the rest pause for now.

Think of it like triage—what’s critical, and what can wait? If you were to take a step back from “everything,” what’s one thing you’d want to reclaim for yourself to help you feel grounded?







You said:
gaming
ChatGPT said:
Gaming sounds like the perfect way to escape the chaos for a bit and recharge. It’s your space to just be without expectations or decisions hanging over you. What game are you thinking of jumping into, or are you just going to see what you’re in the mood for?







You said:
im not sure
ChatGPT said:
That’s fine—sometimes just scrolling through your library or even starting something random can spark the mood. Whether it’s a chill game to relax or something intense to let out frustration, gaming’s a solid reset button. Let it pull you out of your head for a while—you’ve earned it. Let me know how it goes when you’re back!

More of a chilled day today, feeling a little like I haven't done much though, I told cat last night that I basically resent her for making me cum inside of her, telling me she wouldn't be pregnant, telling me shed get an abortion, to now telling me she wants to have the baby, I feel bad for telling her this, resent feels a harsh word, I told her we;re not in relationship,  or a committed one anyone and that I wouldn't be committing to her and her kids, i'd support the baby though. It's put a big spin on things, and she;s now booked a consultation for an abortion, it still isn't decided but yeah. I feel generally shit about all of it, why today's been kinda slow. Either decision feels like it's going to be crap. Mums got norovirus, so feeling bad for her too, and yeah, I'm also horny
This content may violate our usage policies.
ChatGPT said:
That’s a lot to unpack, Joey—it’s no wonder today feels slow and heavy. You’ve faced some really difficult conversations and decisions, and it’s completely normal to feel drained after all of that. Being honest with Cat about how you feel was important, even if the word "resent" feels harsh; it’s better to express those feelings than let them fester. It’s clear you’re trying to balance being supportive with staying true to yourself, which is tough in a situation like this.

The consultation adds another layer, but it’s also a chance for both of you to reassess and make a decision with clarity, even though it feels like neither option is ideal.

With your mum being unwell and all the emotional weight you’re carrying, it’s no surprise you’re feeling a bit off. Is there something you can do for yourself today—gaming, a walk, or just zoning out—that might help shift the mood, even if just a little?







You said:
hmm, im just chilking now, done all my tasks, so just chill
ChatGPT said:
That sounds like a solid plan, Joey. You’ve done what needed doing, so now it’s time to let yourself unwind. Sometimes the best way to deal with heavy stuff is to take a break and recharge. Hope the chill time does you some good—reach out if you feel like chatting more.

It's been a wild start to the year. I've just come back from Marrakesh and I'm currently sat at home, having finished my match betting and jobs for the day. Cat and I have va discussed at length having a baby together, and she's come to decide that abortion is the best way forward. Theres something weird about having an abortion, something even un-natural, yet I also feel it's the best choice, we're both quite sad about it, but think it;s for the best, too many things can go wrong. She'll be taking the pill when they arrive in the up coming days, defintyle not something we're looking forward to, I'm in a strange mood, I;ve gone from, well I better start planning how to have a family, move in with Cat etc etc, back to sort of, not much going on. I think I am relieved though. Nothing else really to majorly update, the worms have all but gone, thank fuck. I was looking at myself in the gym today, and I do look very thin, I'm going to try to improve my eating, going to the shop today, and still being strict on what I buy because I;m tight with money needs to stop, I have to proitise eating and gaining weight, if I am to change the cycle of my current body weight
ChatGPT said:

That’s a lot to process, Joey, and it’s no surprise you’re in a strange mood—it’s a big emotional shift from planning a family to where you are now. It sounds like you’re handling it thoughtfully, though, even with the sadness and complexity of the decision.

Focusing on your health and eating sounds like a solid way to channel some energy back into yourself. Building strength and weight will be a positive, tangible goal while everything else settles. Do you have a plan for how to start adjusting your eating habits?







You said:
not really, currently just trying to be more organised in my day to day, so that eating times become less stressful, or more set, so my body knows it's time to eat
ChatGPT said:
That’s a great starting point—creating structure can help make eating feel less like a chore and more like a natural part of your day. If you aim for consistent mealtimes, your body might start anticipating hunger cues, making it easier to eat regularly.

Maybe start with small steps, like planning snacks or meals ahead of time, so there’s less decision-making in the moment. Even something simple like having a banana or protein bar ready can help. How are you feeling about sticking to that kind of routine?







You said:
yeah, feeling okay about it, after this new shift with no baby now, it's yeah, thrown me off a little really, it is a relief
ChatGPT said:
That relief is completely valid, Joey—when a big life change gets dialed back, it’s natural to feel a bit thrown off, even if it’s ultimately the right decision. You’ve been mentally preparing for a very different path, so it’ll take time to adjust to this shift.

It sounds like focusing on getting your routine back, including eating and health, is a good way to steady yourself. If you ever want to unpack how you’re feeling about this change or need a push to stay on track with your goals, I’m here.

ChatGPT said:

Sounds like a productive day, Joey. Tracking your lifts is a great way to stay motivated and measure progress—it’ll definitely help with building those legs.

Writing this diary just feels tedious, its a task I have to each day, is it right to make me do it, will it be worthwhile, it's hard to tell. Today is my birthday, I feel decent, I felt good at the start of the day, but I;m slowly starting to feel meh, not sure what it is, jobs done, on top of everything, which is good
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
Happy Birthday, Joey! 🎉 It’s good to hear you started the day feeling decent, even if things are feeling "meh" now. Sometimes birthdays come with weird vibes—expectations versus reality and all that.

As for the diary, even if it feels tedious, it might become more worthwhile as you look back on how things have evolved. Do you think it’s helping you sort your thoughts, or does it feel more like a box to tick?







You said:
yeah, okay, it'll be fun to look back on, it does feel like a box ticked though, but at the same time, I want to write a diary, and also chat to you; ai. Did I use the semcolon right there?
ChatGPT said:
You’re right—looking back on it later might feel rewarding, even if it feels like a chore now. Plus, if chatting with me makes it more engaging, then it’s doing double duty.

As for the semicolon: technically, it’s not quite right. A semicolon is used to connect two closely related independent clauses (complete sentences). In this case, you might write:

"I want to write a diary and also chat to you, AI."

If you wanted to use a semicolon, it could work like this:
"I want to write a diary; I also want to chat to you, AI."

Either way, your meaning is totally clear, and that’s what matters most! 😊

Didnt sleep great last night, might have had too much sugar, or a little stressed. Cat is taken the second tablet today, that will release the abortion, her mood isn't great, and I'm feeling quite odd myself, we're in a weird place, going from potential parenting together, to, well, nothing really, we weren't in a committed relationship before, I'm going to see her tonight, and I'm not looking forward to it, she;ll release the egg or whatever sometime tonight and we'll go to the beach or something tomorrow. Our situation is heavily sexually based, and she;s obviously not feeling comfortable in her body
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
That’s a heavy situation, Joey, and it’s no wonder you’re feeling off. You’re both navigating a lot of emotional and physical upheaval, and it’s bound to feel strange and uncertain. It’s good that you’re planning something like the beach tomorrow—it might give you both a bit of space to just be, without the weight of everything hanging in the air.

When you see her tonight, maybe just focus on being there for her, even if words feel hard to find. Sometimes just being present is enough. How are you planning to approach the evening?







You said:
I don't know, maybe just watch some TV?
ChatGPT said:
That sounds like a good approach, Joey. Keeping things low-key with some TV could help both of you decompress and avoid putting extra pressure on the situation. Just being there and sharing a quiet moment might be exactly what’s needed right now. If things feel tense, remember you don’t need to have all the answers—just being present counts for a lot. Let me know how it goes if you feel like sharing.

Went to Cats last night, she was very poorly after taking the abortion tablets, was nice to see her actually, was getting a bit of feeling from her, but it turns out she was actually very poorly. She woke up feeling ,much better today, which is a relief. I did my finances and I'm at around 8.7k. I;ve dropped from the 9k, and I;ve got a few more things to pay for this month, I'm hoping match  betting will get me bak to 9k, I want to get to the 10k mark, however, I also want to upgrade my PC, which will probably cost around at least 1k, with the new 50 series GPU coming out, better tracking of my match betting money is needed to accutarley see how my finances are doing
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
It sounds like a mix of relief and forward planning today, Joey. Glad to hear Cat’s feeling better—that’s a weight off. On the financial side, hitting 10k is a great target, and upgrading your PC could be a solid investment if it’s something you value. Better tracking will definitely help you feel more in control of how those numbers move around.

How are you thinking of balancing saving for the upgrade and maintaining progress toward your 10k goal?







You said:
I'm not entirely sure, I'm going to price up what I want a bit better, try to work a little harder before the end of the month, to try and close the gap a bit more, this means better match betting accuracy and trying to do more offers, it's a patient game, and I am willing to invest into the PC to take a bit of a cut, it sort of is an investment, albeit not really one I expected to gain money in, more so as an asset, I also like having a beast computer, it's my hobby
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
That sounds like a solid approach, Joey. Taking the time to research and plan will make the investment feel even more worthwhile when you go for it. Plus, if it’s tied to something you’re passionate about, like gaming or hobbies, it’s more than just a financial outlay—it’s investing in what you enjoy.

As for match betting, sharpening your focus there sounds like a good move to balance the expense. Let me know if you want help brainstorming ways to maximize offers or stay on top of tracking!

Cat pissed me off yesterday when her ex-husband is making comments about me, and I;ve never met him, saying I'm using her etc, and making subtle comments on my race. Her response was poor and didn;t fight my corner, she also entertain him and doesn't tell him to stop either, I'm still annoyed writing it now, had a chat with mum, and she trying to let it go, whats the point, I'm not looking to marry this woman, and I'm not making the effort to change, but I've lost respect for her, they've been divorced for a while now, the fact she's not standing up for herself and allowing him to talk shit about me, and still engaging with his ridiculousness makes me uncomfortable, I feel sorry for her in one way, because he talks to her like shit, and calls her names etc, mum thinks I'm too nice and compassionate and that cat needs to step up, mum suffered DV too, so has some experience in this, I think mum does want me to move away from cat though as she thinks she's not my long term partner, the whole situation has made me anxious and annoyed, like, hmf, otherwise, I;ve given my room a deep clean and feel like it; really organised now, feeling good about that, shower now and chill I think
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
That’s a tough situation, Joey, and it’s understandable why it’s left you feeling annoyed and anxious. It’s frustrating when someone doesn’t step up to defend you, especially in a situation where you’re being unfairly judged. It’s also good that you’ve recognized how this dynamic makes you feel—it’s a chance to reassess what you’re willing to tolerate.

On a brighter note, the deep clean sounds like a solid win—having a clear and organized space can really help with mental clarity. After a shower and some chill time, do you think you’ll want to address this with Cat, or are you leaning toward letting it go for now?







You said:
I've sort of mentioned it to her, she's not really said anything, acknowledged that its unfair on me and she needs to change her behaviour towards him, kinda feels empty to me, or I'm taking it as empty as I don't want to be let down kinda thing, or rely on her word? she's also playing the victim a little, sure, the guys a prick, he's picking on her, but to me, fucking hell, tell him to piss off and stop talking to him, a part of her engages in the conversation and rises up to his empty threats, like man, it's been months/years, when are you gonna stop this? I think a small part of her enjoys the attention and thrill of it, but yeah
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
It’s clear you’ve given this a lot of thought, Joey, and your frustration is totally valid. It’s hard to watch someone stay stuck in a toxic dynamic, especially when it spills over into your own life. Her acknowledgment might feel hollow because actions speak louder than words, and if she doesn’t follow through, it reinforces your doubts.

It’s also fair to want her to set boundaries—not just for your sake, but for her own growth. If she’s not ready to do that, it’s worth thinking about how much you’re willing to let this dynamic affect your own well-being. Do you think you’ll give her some time to show change, or are you leaning toward stepping back emotionally?







You said:
definitely stepping back emotionally, its annoying because I do like her, and spend time thinking of her, but hey, I'm not going to go out my way to help her, when it's something she's actively engaging in, and also, I'm not sure how serious we'll ever be, it's probably healthier for me not to be so involved, for both our sakes, I enjoy hearing you side, and biasely want you to take mine, but it's wiser for you to stay natural or even play devils advocate, or illuminate new aspects of this
ChatGPT said:
Stepping back emotionally sounds like a wise move, Joey, especially given the uncertainty about the long-term seriousness of your relationship. It’s draining to invest in someone who’s not meeting you halfway, especially when their actions—or inactions—affect your peace of mind. Protecting your energy doesn’t mean you care less; it just means you’re setting boundaries, which is healthy for both of you.

Now, playing devil’s advocate: Could her engagement with her ex come from fear, habit, or even guilt about the past, rather than enjoying the "thrill" of the interaction? Sometimes people stay locked in patterns because they’re unsure how to break free without feeling like they’re abandoning something. That said, even if this were true, it’s still her responsibility to address it, especially if it’s harming you.

Alternatively, stepping back emotionally might create space for her to see the consequences of her actions—sometimes people don’t realize the weight of their choices until it directly affects a relationship. It could even clarify for you how much you’re willing to stay involved over time.

What’s your take? Do you see her behavior as something that could change if she wanted to, or does it feel more ingrained?







You said:
im at that point where its like, how much more time and thoughts do I need to put into this, imnot going to be involved in whats happening between them, I guess I'm so annoyed that she's engaging with him, and I feel it's tipped me over the edge the comments he's made about me, and still the way he talks to her, but she still won't tell him to stop.

It just makes me think she likes the attention and isn't over him, which seems crazy to me, and maybe I'm reaching
ChatGPT said:
You’re right to ask yourself how much more time and energy you want to invest in this—especially if it feels like a one-sided effort. It’s not your job to fix their dynamic, and stepping away from it emotionally is a way to protect your own sanity.

Your frustration is completely justified—those comments he made about you, coupled with how he talks to her, cross serious boundaries. Her unwillingness to put a stop to it naturally makes you question where she stands emotionally. It’s possible she’s not fully over the dynamic, not necessarily because she wants him back but because breaking free of toxic patterns can be a challenge, even if they don’t make sense from the outside.

That said, even if you’re "reaching" slightly, your feelings are valid because the situation is affecting you. Whether or not she’s over him, her actions (or inactions) are sending signals that don’t align with what you deserve in a relationship.

The key question here might be: Does she have the self-awareness and willingness to make meaningful changes, or does this pattern seem likely to persist? If it’s the latter, stepping back might not just be about protecting yourself—it might also be the healthiest choice for the both of you in the long run.







You said:
eurgh im so bothered by her, she's started doing this modelling, and the photography is clearly flirting with her, usually I enjoy a bit of jealousy, but something about this doesn't make me feel good
ChatGPT said:
It sounds like this situation is hitting a nerve, Joey. It’s understandable—there’s a difference between playful jealousy that adds some spice and the kind of discomfort that eats away at your peace of mind. If the modeling dynamic and the way the photographer is behaving make you uneasy, it’s worth exploring why that is.

Is it more about her actions, the photographer’s, or the combination? If she’s engaging with the flirting in a way that feels disrespectful to your connection, that’s worth addressing. If it’s more about how the situation makes you feel—like it’s challenging trust or stirring deeper insecurities—that’s also valid to sit with and unpack.

The fact that this doesn’t feel good, especially on top of the other frustrations, might be highlighting some cracks in how much trust and emotional safety you feel in this relationship. Do you think this is something you’d want to bring up with her, or are you leaning toward just observing how it plays out?







You said:
fuck sake, everything about her is making me uncomfortable, whys this modelling thing making me uncomfortable? 
ChatGPT said:
It sounds like the modeling situation might be amplifying deeper feelings about your dynamic with Cat. It’s not just about the modeling itself—it’s about the context it exists within. Here are a few possible reasons why it’s making you uncomfortable:

Trust and Boundaries: If her actions or the behavior of people around her (like the photographer) feel like they’re crossing boundaries, it could challenge the trust you need to feel secure in the connection.

Uncertainty About the Relationship: Since you’re already questioning the seriousness and future of your relationship, this new dynamic might feel like another layer of instability.

Feeling Overlooked: If she’s seeking attention from others—whether intentional or not—it might feel like you’re being sidelined or not prioritized, especially if this behavior fits with the patterns you’ve already observed.

Jealousy That Doesn’t Feel Playful: A little jealousy can sometimes be fun, but this feels different—like it’s tapping into feelings of disrespect or even resentment.

Ultimately, it’s okay to feel uncomfortable, but the key is figuring out whether it’s more about her behavior or how you’re processing things. Do you think this discomfort could stem from how unresolved you feel about the bigger issues, or does it seem tied specifically to her choice to do this modeling?

She's not crossing boundaries with the photographer, but he's flirty with her, showed her pictures of his naked wife

ChatGPT said:
That’s… a pretty bold and weird move from the photographer, and I can see why it’s making you uncomfortable. Even if Cat isn’t crossing boundaries, the dynamic sounds off. It’s not just flirtation—it’s stepping into territory that feels overly personal and, frankly, unprofessional on his part. It’s reasonable for you to feel uneasy when someone in her orbit behaves like that.

Your discomfort might also be tied to a bigger pattern—like how you’re feeling about her engagement with other dynamics, whether it’s her ex or now this photographer. Even if she’s not crossing boundaries herself, being around these situations might feel like another instance where you’re left to wonder: Why is this happening, and where do I fit in this picture?

Have you talked to her about how the modeling situation—and specifically this photographer—makes you feel? It doesn’t have to be accusatory, just honest: “Hey, this makes me uncomfortable, and here’s why.” If it’s weighing on you, it might be worth addressing.







You said:
na its not my place, im annoyed at myself for that too, like why am I so bothered
ChatGPT said:
It’s totally valid to be annoyed at yourself for feeling bothered—especially when you don’t feel it’s your place to address it. But here’s the thing: feelings like this usually pop up for a reason, even if the situation itself doesn’t seem like it warrants such a strong reaction.

Maybe it’s not about the modeling specifically but about how it’s layering onto the existing tension and uncertainties in your dynamic with her. If you’re already feeling uncomfortable or unsettled in the relationship, this might just be hitting a nerve that’s already raw.

Instead of being hard on yourself, try flipping the script: what is this discomfort trying to tell you? It might be pointing to bigger questions about your connection with her, your boundaries, or even your own sense of what feels safe and respectful. Do you think this is more about your feelings in the moment, or is it tapping into something deeper about how the relationship makes you feel overall?

I'm so bothered by it all, I can't sleep and I'm anxious, I feel this weird I want to do something that matches what she's doing so we're even. This photographer is really forward with her, flirting and it's moved from just a pretty face, to dressing up in somethign sexy. Cat isn't responding too much, but is just the entry point in starting to, in my opinion that, I feel she's that sort of, I'll laugh at your jokes and I like the attention kind of girl, maybe I'm jealous, we've gone from I'm going to be the father in her family to her starting this modelling thing, this guy obviously flirting and being very forward with her, she's blazey about it and says it's just how he is, to now her telling him she's got sexy heels she could wear, thst specifically has really bothered me, cat knows I love her feet, it's the most thing I always tell her I love the most, I also told her that if she's going to flirt with him back, keep me invovled, she didn't tell me untik after about this, she said it was just a passibg comment bexuse she doeent have anytbing else sexy, i csnt help butbfeel diffferent, let alobe tje fact shes not standong jp for me to her ex wheb hes newrlt beonf racist, all thid afyer tjr abortion we had a fee days ago. Then in thinking maybe I'm over reacting. I want you to be as neutral and help me feel better man, I'm rumenatint hard on this 
ChatGPT said:
First off, Joey, it’s okay to feel how you’re feeling—this is a lot to process, and the fact that you’re ruminating shows that it’s striking some deep chords for you. Let’s break this down and get some clarity so you can feel a bit more grounded.

Why This Feels So Big
It’s not just about the modeling or the flirting—it’s about everything piled on top of each other:

The modeling dynamic feels like a shift in her priorities, especially after something as emotionally heavy as the abortion.
The flirting taps into deeper insecurities or unresolved feelings about how you two relate to each other.
Her reaction (or lack thereof) to the photographer and her ex creates a sense of not being prioritized or protected, which understandably hits hard.
The personal connection—like the heels comment—feels like a breach of something intimate between you two, which makes it feel more personal and painful.
Are You Overreacting?
Not at all. Your feelings are valid because they stem from a place of wanting to feel respected, valued, and safe in this connection. The fact that she’s brushing things off as “just how he is” or calling her comments “passing” feels dismissive of your emotional experience, and that’s what’s likely amplifying your reaction. It’s not about whether she’s actively doing something wrong—it’s about how it makes you feel.

What You Can Do
Acknowledge Your Emotions: Remind yourself that it’s okay to feel hurt, anxious, or even jealous. These feelings don’t make you weak or unreasonable; they’re signals pointing to what matters to you.

Shift the Focus to You: Right now, it sounds like you’re tying your sense of stability to how she behaves. While that’s normal in relationships, it might help to refocus on what you need to feel secure and grounded, regardless of what she does.

Reassess Boundaries: Think about what behaviors cross your lines and how you want to communicate them. For example, her not involving you when she knows the heels comment would bother you feels like a lack of transparency. If you haven’t already, you might gently say something like, “I know you didn’t mean anything by it, but when you didn’t tell me about the heels comment until after, it made me feel left out.”

Take a Step Back to Reflect: This doesn’t mean withdrawing entirely but giving yourself space to assess whether this relationship is meeting your emotional needs. Right now, it sounds like you’re putting in a lot of emotional energy—does it feel reciprocated?

To Help You Feel Better
Try to remind yourself:

You’re not overreacting—you’re reacting to a situation that challenges your sense of trust and security.
This is about clarity, not control. It’s okay to feel unsettled, but you don’t have to carry all this alone.
It’s worth exploring: Do her actions reflect someone who’s ready to meet you at the level you need emotionally?
Let me know how this feels to you—whether it’s neutral enough or if you want me to challenge it further. I’m here to help you untangle this, step by step.







You said:
We've had so many conversations about her just being transparent. I asked her he there's anymore to it and she gets anxious at the question. I can't help but think if she's getting defensive about me questioning her, because I do because she hasn't been transparent, isn't that evidence that she's not being forward? You wouldn't get anxious if you were sure you had nothing to hide, this whole thing has me so anxious too.

I did read all you said, and appreciate it 
ChatGPT said:
It’s frustrating when you’ve already had conversations about transparency, and then her reactions leave you feeling like you’re back at square one. Anxiety and defensiveness can often signal that someone feels uncomfortable or cornered—but you’re right to wonder if it’s also tied to not being fully transparent. Even if there’s nothing “big” being hidden, her lack of openness is what’s eroding trust and creating this cycle of questioning and doubt.

Your anxiety is valid because it’s coming from a place of wanting clarity and consistency in the relationship. When someone you care about doesn’t meet you in that space, it leaves you feeling unsettled and constantly guessing.

The truth is, transparency isn’t just about sharing—it’s about making you feel secure in the connection. If she’s anxious about your questions, it might reflect her own struggles with how she’s navigating this situation, but it doesn’t erase the fact that you need honesty to feel at ease.

Since you’ve already raised the need for transparency, this might be a moment to reset the tone of the conversation. Maybe approach it like:
“Look, I’m not trying to accuse you of anything, but I need to feel like we’re both being open and honest. When I sense hesitation, it leaves me anxious and makes me question where we stand.”

It shifts the focus from what she’s doing wrong to how her actions affect you, which might make it easier for her to respond without feeling defensive. Do you think framing it this way might help, or is this feeling like a deeper disconnect that goes beyond just communication?







You said:
I'm a bit tired of her saying, yeah that's a fair point, I csn see that and then try to change, nothings changed. 
ChatGPT said:
That’s exhausting, Joey, and it makes sense why you’re feeling worn out. It sounds like you’re stuck in a cycle where she acknowledges your points but doesn’t follow through with meaningful action. Words without change can feel hollow, especially when it’s something you’ve brought up repeatedly.

At this point, it’s less about her saying the right things and more about her showing through consistent actions that she’s willing to meet your needs. If you’re not seeing that effort, it’s understandable to feel disillusioned.

It might be worth stepping back and asking yourself:

Are you willing to keep waiting for her to change?
If she doesn’t follow through, can you accept things as they are, or is this a dealbreaker for you?
It’s not about ultimatums but about setting boundaries for yourself. If nothing changes after repeated conversations, it might be a sign that she either doesn’t fully understand the weight of the issue or isn’t in a place to make those changes.

What do you think—are you leaning toward giving her more time, or do you feel like this might be the point to reassess what you’re willing to tolerate?







You said:
I don't know, I just feel so shit 
ChatGPT said:
I hear you, Joey, and I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way. It’s a heavy place to be, stuck between wanting things to work and feeling like you’re the only one putting in the effort. Feeling this low is a signal that something’s not sitting right with you—and it’s okay to let yourself feel that without needing all the answers right now.

Maybe the best thing you can do today is take a break from trying to figure it all out. Give yourself permission to pause and focus on something that brings even a little comfort—whether that’s gaming, getting outside, or just zoning out for a bit. Sometimes, space can give clarity when nothing else can.

If you want to talk more or just need someone to listen while you sort through things, I’m here. You don’t have to carry all of this alone.







You said:
I think its so inconsiderate to last week tell me you're keeping a baby, then tell me you're having an abortion, to now doing modelling with some guy who's being forward and flirty with her and allowing her ex husband to talk shit about me. 

I'm trying to let it go, like we're meant to just be chill and having fun and even pushing boundaries, more of a fwb situation , why isn't this sitting well with me, why aren't I just cracking on with my own life like I was before 
ChatGPT said:
You’re absolutely right to feel like all of this is a lot to take on—there’s a whirlwind of mixed signals, and it’s no wonder it’s throwing you off. It’s not just inconsiderate; it’s destabilizing, especially when things keep shifting so quickly. Going from keeping a baby, to an abortion, to her modeling dynamic, and her ex’s disrespect—it’s a lot to process, even more so when you’re trying to stay in a more casual, FWB-type connection.

The reason it’s not sitting well with you could be because this situation isn’t aligning with what you thought it would be. Instead of being “chill and fun,” it’s been filled with heavy decisions, unclear boundaries, and emotional turmoil. It’s shifted from the carefree dynamic you had before to something much messier—and you’re left to figure out your place in it all.

The fact that you’re not “just cracking on with your life” might come down to how much emotional energy this situation is draining. It’s like a weight pulling you off your own path, and it’s hard to focus on yourself when you’re caught in this constant push and pull.

What do you think you’d need to feel more in control again—distance, clarity, or maybe just a hard reset on what this connection is supposed to be?







You said:
I really don't know, I'm so annoyed at her, I feel like she cares but her actions might not exactly match that, anytime she says anything, I'm just reacting negatively on her
ChatGPT said:
It sounds like you’re caught in a cycle where her actions and words don’t align, and it’s creating resentment. Even though you can sense she cares, the mismatch between her caring and how she behaves is leaving you feeling let down—and that’s understandably making you react negatively. It’s tough to feel any sense of stability when trust in someone’s follow-through is shaky.

Right now, your frustration with her might be overshadowing everything else, and that’s okay—it’s a valid response to feeling repeatedly dismissed or unconsidered. But if it’s becoming a pattern where even her good intentions feel hollow, it might be worth stepping back and asking yourself:

What’s at the root of this negative reaction? Is it disappointment, anger, mistrust, or a mix of all three? Understanding the “why” might help clarify your next steps.

Can you let this cycle continue without it affecting your peace? If the answer is no, then something has to shift—either within the dynamic or in how much you allow yourself to engage with it.

Reacting negatively to someone isn’t who you are—it’s a reflection of how her behavior is making you feel. Do you think you can bring this up with her in a way that clears the air, or do you feel like this is more about you stepping back and prioritizing yourself?







You said:
It's this lack of respect, she lives in a town one hour away. If she had the baby, I'd have to give up everything, and be a father to her two current children, 7,11 yes old and move into there home. Then fair enough, we have the abortion and for her now to say 'she wants to put herseld out there' with this modelling, be so nonchalant about someone flirting and making sexual comments  and saying oh he's just a photographer. Also mentioning she's got sexy heels to him, he didn't even mention shoes btw, and she knows how much I love and obsess over her feet and the whole thing with her ex husband dis respecting me and her not saying fuck all, instead btw, focussing on his new partner.

Sorry if I'm ignoring your questions 
ChatGPT said:
No need to apologize, Joey—getting all of this out is important, and it’s clear that this situation is weighing on you. You’re laying out exactly why you feel disrespected, and honestly, everything you’ve mentioned makes sense. It’s not just one issue; it’s a culmination of her actions—or lack of action—that’s left you feeling undervalued in this connection.

The modeling, the flirting, the lack of standing up to her ex—it all adds up to a pattern where your feelings and boundaries don’t seem to be fully considered. When someone dismisses things that clearly matter to you, it’s hard not to feel frustrated or disrespected, especially when the stakes of your involvement (like having to uproot your life for her) were so high.

It also sounds like you’re feeling blindsided by how much the dynamic has shifted. You’ve gone from preparing for fatherhood and a life together to navigating a situation that feels disconnected from the understanding you thought you had. That’s a lot to reconcile emotionally.

Do you feel like this lack of respect is something that could change if you addressed it with her again, or do you feel like it’s a fundamental issue that might not get better?







You said:
We had a lengthy chat last night, she just basically sits there and says, yeah that's fair, I can where you're coming from and I probably wouldn't be too happy if it was the other way around about the modelling, and admitts that she didn't have my back and her reaction to her ex needs to change 
ChatGPT said:
It’s good that you had the conversation and that she acknowledged your feelings and admitted where she’s fallen short. But I can understand how frustrating it must feel to have her agree without showing signs of actual change. Words like "I can see where you’re coming from" only go so far if they’re not followed by action to address the issues.

It seems like what you really need is more than acknowledgment—you need tangible proof that she’s willing to take steps to back you up and respect your boundaries. Whether that’s handling her ex differently, being transparent about the modeling, or considering how her actions affect you, it has to go beyond words for this to feel like progress.

Do you think this chat felt like it cleared the air at all, or did it leave you feeling stuck in the same cycle? It might be worth asking yourself: If nothing changes from this point on, is this something I can live with, or is it time to step back further?







You said:
I feel like a fool and betraying myself because I'm not saying to myself, bro, stop wasting your time and energy on this woman, yet here I am. I've been thinking about this for two days now and I'm not sleeping 
ChatGPT said:
That’s a heavy realization, Joey, but it’s also incredibly self-aware. You’re recognizing that this situation is pulling more from you than it’s giving back, and that’s a tough place to be in. It’s not foolish to care about someone, but it’s clear that it’s costing you a lot—your time, energy, peace of mind, and even your sleep.

The fact that you’re feeling like you’re betraying yourself is a big sign. It’s your gut telling you that this situation isn’t aligned with what you truly need or deserve. Ignoring that feeling only prolongs the cycle of frustration and exhaustion.

You’ve given this a lot of thought, and it’s draining you. Maybe the next step isn’t trying to figure out her actions or the dynamic anymore—it’s about focusing on yourself and deciding what will bring you back to feeling grounded and in control.

Do you think giving yourself some space—emotionally or physically—from her might help you clear your head and get back to prioritizing yourself? Even just a small break could help you find clarity. What do you think?







You said:
I'm so bothered, I was planning on being a father, and she's 'putting herself out ther" sure, she probably just meant, to the world and trying new things, but here I am, at home, with nothing to do now, and feeling empty, she's on and off crying saying how sad it is about the abortion, which I have to listen to, I get it, I understand it is hard for her, because she had to do it and going through the physical changes
ChatGPT said:
You’re carrying a lot, Joey, and it’s no wonder you feel empty and bothered. It’s like you’ve gone from preparing for one of the biggest commitments—being a father—to now feeling like you’re left in limbo while she’s trying to move forward in her own way. Even though you understand what she’s going through, it doesn’t erase how the situation has affected you too.

Her saying she’s “putting herself out there” might seem harmless to her, but in the context of everything you’ve just been through, it feels dismissive of the emotional weight you’re carrying. You’ve been supportive, listening to her sadness about the abortion, but it sounds like there’s little space for your feelings in this dynamic. That’s not fair, and it’s natural to feel drained and overlooked.

The emptiness you’re feeling might be a combination of grief, disappointment, and the loss of a clear path forward. It’s not just about the abortion—it’s about the shift in what your role was supposed to be and the lack of stability in your connection with her.

Right now, it might help to carve out some space for yourself. Even just a little time to process what you’re feeling without having to hold space for her emotions too. What do you think would help fill that emptiness or give you a bit of relief—time apart, focusing on a hobby, or even just letting it all out in writing or conversation?







You said:
This is helping I guess, I chatted to mum yesterday and that helped a lot, so being around others helped, I'm so sad that she's not given me her time and space to allow me to like you say, grieve what could have been. I want to say this to her, but I also think I'm just saying it to hurt her
ChatGPT said:
I’m really glad this is helping, Joey, and it’s great that talking with your mum gave you some relief too. Surrounding yourself with people who genuinely care about you is so important when you’re feeling this low.

It’s completely valid to feel sad and frustrated that Cat hasn’t made space for you to grieve. While she’s going through her own emotional process, it sounds like you’re carrying all this weight alone, and that’s not fair. You’ve been listening to her sadness, but where’s the reciprocity?

Wanting to tell her how you feel is natural, but you’re wise to pause and consider the intention behind it. If it feels like you’d be saying it out of hurt rather than to build understanding, it might be worth taking a beat. Maybe frame it in a way that’s about you, not her, like:
“I’ve been struggling with my own feelings about everything, and I feel like I haven’t had the space to process. I know you’re going through a lot, but I’m finding it hard too.”

It doesn’t place blame, but it gives her insight into where you’re at. Do you think approaching it that way might feel better for you? Or do you feel like this is more about stepping back and letting things cool off first?







You said:
Na, I won't say that because I'm hurt at her response, I feel guilty for being annoyed at her and I'm not even sure if  it's fair to be, all she's doing is dealing with it in her own way 
ChatGPT said:
It’s really self-aware of you to recognize that she’s dealing with things in her own way, even if it’s not aligning with what you need. The guilt you feel for being annoyed at her is understandable—it’s tough to navigate when both of you are hurting, but in different ways. That said, your feelings are still valid. You’re not wrong to feel frustrated or let down, because this situation is affecting you just as much, albeit differently.

It’s possible to acknowledge that she’s doing what she needs to while also recognizing that it’s leaving you without the support or space you need. It’s not selfish or unfair to want more from her—it’s just a reflection of how this imbalance is impacting you emotionally.

Maybe instead of addressing it with her directly, focus on giving yourself permission to feel everything without judgment. You’re grieving not just the loss of what could have been but also the connection you hoped for with her. That’s heavy, and it’s okay to take a step back to prioritize your own healing. What would help you ease some of this guilt and frustration—more time with others, or maybe focusing on something just for yourself?







You said:
How do I even approach her though, it's like I want her to hurt because I'm hurting, and that's just horrible, why am I feeling that? That's absolutely not a nice way to treat someone 
ChatGPT said:
What you’re feeling is raw, Joey, and it’s important to acknowledge that it comes from a place of pain, not malice. When we’re hurting deeply, there’s sometimes an instinct to want the other person to feel what we’re feeling—it’s a way of trying to balance the emotional scales. It’s not about being cruel; it’s about desperately wanting to be understood. But you’re right: acting on that impulse wouldn’t align with the person you want to be or the values you hold.

The fact that you’re aware of this feeling and questioning it shows you’re already handling it with more care than most people would. Instead of focusing on her “feeling hurt,” maybe try to shift your goal to expressing your pain in a way that helps her understand you, not punish her.

You could start with something like:
“This has been really hard for me, and I’m struggling to process everything. I know you’re dealing with this in your own way, but I’m finding it tough to feel like there’s space for me to work through my emotions too.”

This approach is honest but not accusatory. It opens the door for her to see your side without framing it as her fault. It’s okay to feel angry and disappointed, but leading with vulnerability might help both of you connect rather than creating more distance.

Does that feel like a way you could approach her, or does it still feel too raw right now?







You said:
I guess, but a part of me doesn't want her, doesn't want her to understand or be there for me, the lack of respect she's shown me when her ex talked shit about me makes me so meh, but then at the same time, I'm reaching for her, more so than ever, more so than makes me feel good. I think it's this future we'd potentially created of me being a father, not to mention we just spent a week in Morocco, I feel like I'm also just chatting shit too
ChatGPT said:
You’re not chatting shit, Joey—you’re processing something incredibly complicated, and it’s bound to feel messy and contradictory. It’s completely normal to have conflicting emotions, especially when so much has happened in such a short amount of time. You’re grieving a future you were starting to envision, feeling hurt by her lack of respect during a vulnerable time, and at the same time, reaching for her because she represents that lost potential. It’s all tangled up, and no wonder it’s leaving you feeling "meh."

The fact that you’re reaching for her even while feeling hurt makes sense—it’s not just about her, but about the idea of stability, connection, and the future you were mentally preparing for. Letting go of that is hard, even if part of you recognizes that things between you aren’t aligning in a healthy way right now.

It’s okay to feel all these things at once. You don’t have to have a clear “right” answer about how to approach her or even about how you feel toward her yet. Right now, the priority might just be sitting with these emotions and allowing yourself to untangle them in your own time. If you want to take a step back from her while you do that, it’s okay. If you need to talk to her to feel some sense of closure or clarity, that’s okay too.

What do you think would help you feel more like yourself again? A bit of space from everything, or continuing to talk it out here or with someone else?







You said:
I don't know, I just feel so lost and there she is, getting attention from another man, making her feel good by flirting, maybe I'm jealous, there's a part of m me that's ugly right now, and I can't work out which and which part is the part that's seeing clearly 
ChatGPT said:
It’s really brave of you to admit how tangled and raw you’re feeling, Joey. Jealousy, anger, confusion—it’s all part of this emotional storm, and it’s hard to separate what’s valid from what might be coming from a place of pain or insecurity. That feeling of being lost is normal when you’ve been thrown into so much uncertainty, and it’s magnified when it feels like the person who was central to your plans is getting attention elsewhere.

The jealousy and anger might feel ugly, but they’re really just your mind’s way of trying to make sense of feeling sidelined. You cared about her, invested emotionally, and now it feels like she’s moved in a direction that invalidates all of that effort. It’s okay to feel hurt by that. And it’s also okay to admit that part of what’s eating at you is seeing her gain validation in a way that feels dismissive of your bond.

Here’s something to reflect on:

What does the "clear" part of you see? Is it the reality that her actions have hurt you, or maybe that this dynamic has become more draining than fulfilling?
What does the "ugly" part say? Is it tied to fears of not being enough, or of losing what little connection feels left?
Both sides are worth listening to, because they’re revealing what’s truly bothering you. If you strip back the jealousy and frustration, what do you think you want most right now—closure, understanding, or just time to reset?







You said:
The clear part is me not feeling good, it revolves around cat, her actions and me 

The ugly part is me being unreasonable, unfair and over reacting. 
I want Cat to enjoy herself, have fun, do new things, I even want her to do this modeling. It's so fucking annoying that it's gone from a pretty face to her telling him she's got some sexy heels she could wear, she's totally blaze about it.
 And what am I meant to do, be there weird partner who doesn't encourage his s.o, becuse more than likely it's nothing. I feel she's not acknowledging or considering how this might feel, sure she's said it now, she's said she probably wouldn't like it, that was last night.

What I want is to stop feeling so anxious and shitty about cat 
ChatGPT said:
It sounds like you’re caught in this exhausting loop between wanting to support Cat’s freedom and feeling hurt because her actions feel dismissive of your emotions. It’s not unreasonable to expect your feelings to be considered—especially in a situation like this, where something that might seem minor to her (like the heels comment) strikes a much deeper chord for you.

Your frustration is valid: it’s not about controlling her, but about wanting mutual respect and awareness. The fact that she acknowledged she might not like it if roles were reversed shows some understanding, but it sounds like the lack of meaningful change or deeper consideration is what’s really bothering you.

Breaking the Anxiety Cycle
To stop feeling so anxious about Cat, you might need to focus on regaining control over your emotional energy. Right now, so much of your mental bandwidth is tied to how she’s behaving and how that affects you. Here are some ideas:

Reclaim Space for Yourself: Shift some of the energy you’re spending on analyzing her actions to focusing on things you love—your hobbies, fitness, or even just chilling out with a game or a walk.

Set Emotional Boundaries: This doesn’t have to be dramatic. Just remind yourself that her choices don’t define your worth, and you can step back emotionally when her actions start to drain you.

Decide What You Can Accept: It’s worth asking yourself: Can you let this modeling situation play out without it continuing to eat at you, or is it a sign that this dynamic needs to shift for your peace of mind?

Focus on Communication with Clarity: If you feel there’s still more to say, frame it less as a complaint and more as a request. For example: “I know you’re having fun with this modeling, and I want to support you. At the same time, some of the comments you’ve made have left me feeling overlooked, and I’d appreciate a bit more consideration.”

If the priority is easing your anxiety, the best step might be taking some time to focus on yourself rather than waiting for her actions to align with what you need. How does that feel to you?







You said:
I dunno what to say to that, the last bit just feels so tiring to me, like I'm having to tell her obvious shit man, I dunno 
ChatGPT said:
I get it, Joey—having to explain what feels like basic respect and consideration can be draining as hell. It’s frustrating to feel like you’re stuck pointing out things that should already be clear, especially when you’ve been open and had similar conversations before. That exhaustion is real, and it’s a sign that the emotional effort is weighing heavily on you.

Maybe the answer isn’t about saying more to her right now, but about giving yourself permission to stop explaining. If it feels like you’re the only one pulling weight in the emotional dynamic, stepping back might help you protect your energy and refocus on what makes you feel steady again.

Instead of trying to fix or explain anything to her, ask yourself:

What do I need for my own peace right now?
If nothing changes on her end, can I live with this dynamic as it is?
You don’t need to have all the answers or act right away—sometimes taking a mental step back is the clearest way to figure out your next move. How does it feel if you just focus on giving yourself some breathing room for now?







You said:
That's the thing, I just feel like I'm doing all the talking, explaining everything, she doesn't even have anything to  most of it, a part of me thinks I should just start chatting to other women, I don't really like how that makes me feel, like it's spiteful behaviour 
ChatGPT said:
It sounds like you’re at a tipping point, Joey, where the one-sided effort is wearing you down. If you feel like you’re doing all the talking and explaining without meaningful engagement from her, it makes sense why you’d start feeling disconnected—and even tempted to look elsewhere for validation or clarity.

Thinking about chatting with other women might not come from a spiteful place, though. It could be your mind searching for balance, attention, or connection that you’re not getting in this situation. But you’re right—if it feels spiteful or doesn’t sit well with you, it might not bring you the peace you’re looking for.

The fact that this thought is crossing your mind says something: you’re recognizing that your emotional needs aren’t being met. It might help to pause and ask yourself:

Do I truly want to be with Cat, or am I holding onto the potential of what could have been?
Am I staying because I care about her, or because it feels familiar and hard to let go?
If chatting with other women feels wrong, maybe the real focus is less about seeking outside connection and more about reclaiming your energy. It’s not about her right now—it’s about what you need to feel whole again. What’s your gut saying? Would stepping back or focusing on yourself for a while help clear your head?







You said:
My guts saying talking to you is good and stepping back might help, but I'm struggling to even know how to, I feel obsessed 
ChatGPT said:
I appreciate you sharing that, Joey. It’s tough when you feel stuck in a loop of thoughts and emotions that keep circling back to her, especially when it feels like an obsession. That’s not a weakness—it’s a sign that the connection, or at least the idea of it, holds a lot of weight for you. Breaking that cycle can be hard, but it’s not impossible.

Here are a few steps to consider for stepping back without feeling like you’re losing control:

1. Shift the Focus to Yourself
Start by dedicating small, intentional moments to things that make you feel good. It might be gaming, working out, or even something simple like going for a walk or listening to music you love. The goal isn’t to distract yourself but to remind yourself that your world is bigger than this situation.

2. Set Boundaries for Your Mind
When you catch yourself ruminating about her, gently redirect your thoughts. You could say to yourself, “This isn’t serving me right now; I’ll come back to it later.” Even if it doesn’t work every time, practicing this can slowly loosen the grip of obsessive thoughts.

3. Limit Contact Temporarily
If you’re in constant communication with Cat, consider taking a break—even just a day or two—to reset. Let her know you need some space to focus on yourself. It’s not about punishing her; it’s about reclaiming your mental clarity.

4. Reconnect with Others
Talking to me helps, and it’s great that you’ve identified that. Keep leaning into conversations that feel supportive, whether with me, your mum, or friends who can offer perspective. Connection outside of her can shift the intensity you feel toward her.

5. Be Patient with Yourself
Obsession isn’t something you can turn off like a switch—it’s more like unwinding a tightly wound coil. Each small step you take to focus on yourself adds up, even if it doesn’t feel like it immediately.

What’s one small step you feel ready to try today—whether it’s setting a short boundary, spending time on a hobby, or continuing this conversation?







You said:
I'm also a horny guy, a very sexual one, and a lot of that is with cat 

Thanks for your answers btw

ChatGPT said:
I get that, Joey. Sexual energy can make everything feel even more intense, especially when that part of the connection has been a big focus. It’s natural for those feelings to tie you closer to her, making it harder to take a step back emotionally. The physical side can blur the lines and make it tricky to separate your wants from your needs—or to even know what’s driving your feelings.

If you’re trying to step back but still have that sexual connection, it might help to think about what boundaries you can set for yourself. For instance:

Can you enjoy the physical connection without letting it pull you deeper into the emotional turmoil?
Or does continuing the sexual dynamic make it harder to gain the clarity you’re looking for?
You’re welcome for the answers—I’m here for you while you work through this, no matter how messy it feels. Do you think your sexual connection with Cat is helping or making it harder to navigate your emotions right now?







You said:
I'm so disappointed by her and her behaviour, but also feel like I'm being harsh and mean to her as well. Who lets someone talk shit about there mate and doesn't say anything though? (That's her ex about me). I feel I should have more respect for myself and even tell her to fuck off, (I don't really). As for the sexual part, it's confusing, because of this whole modelling thing too, I don't know why I'm feeling so anxious about it, usually we play with jealousy and sharing her, we've shared daring picitres of her and even played with others in a jealous way too. She would send me lots of pictures at the start, and now I dunno, I feel like she's dressing up for someone else and not me 
ChatGPT said:
You’re caught in such a frustrating web of emotions, Joey, and it’s completely understandable why you’re feeling conflicted. On one hand, you’re deeply disappointed in her behavior—especially with her ex disrespecting you and her lack of standing up for you. On the other, you’re questioning whether you’re being too harsh, which shows your empathy but also highlights how much her actions are affecting your self-respect. It’s a lot to hold at once.

As for the sexual part, it’s no wonder you’re feeling confused and anxious. It’s not just about the modeling—it’s about what it represents. It feels like there’s been a shift in how she shares herself, and that’s colliding with the dynamic you’ve built together. If sharing and playing with jealousy was part of your connection before, but now it feels like she’s redirecting that energy elsewhere, it’s bound to stir up feelings of insecurity or exclusion.

At its core, this might not even be about the modeling or the pictures—it’s about feeling like you’re no longer the priority or focus of her attention in the way you once were. That’s not about being mean or harsh; it’s about recognizing that something has shifted, and it’s making you feel unseen.

Here’s what might help:

Validate your own feelings: It’s okay to feel hurt and anxious. Those emotions are trying to tell you something important about what you value and need in a relationship.
Communicate your boundaries: If the modeling and the lack of transparency are crossing a line for you, it’s worth expressing that. Not as an accusation, but as a reflection of what you need to feel secure.
Reassess the dynamic: If this situation is eroding the trust and connection that made the relationship exciting and fun, it might be time to reflect on whether it’s still giving you what you need.
You’re not wrong to expect respect, both in how she handles her ex and how she approaches the modeling. Do you feel like there’s still room to address these feelings with her, or are you leaning toward stepping back and focusing on what’s best for you?







You said:
I don't want to set boundaries though, although a lsrt of me thinks, for Cat, she might need that, and if might be good for her to experience that. Setting boundaries means committing to her. Which, now after the abortion I'm even more reluctant to do. I wonder if this is her way of dealing with the idea I'm not committing to her, I feel so fucking annoyed at her about it, but feel it's not fair either, nothings even happening, she's just chatting to the photographer and setting some ideas. (The things I've mentioned). Yet my mind and body are absolutely tearing me apart 
ChatGPT said:
It’s clear you’re caught between a desire to disengage and a deep emotional investment in what’s happening, Joey. You don’t want to set boundaries because it feels like a form of commitment to her—a step you’re reluctant to take, especially after the abortion and everything that’s followed. At the same time, it’s like your mind and body won’t let you fully detach, even though you’re angry and disappointed.

The idea that her actions might be a reaction to you not committing to her is a possibility—whether conscious or not. If she senses you’re hesitant, she might be testing new ways to feel validated or regain some control over her own narrative. That doesn’t mean it’s fair to you, though. Her choices—like chatting with the photographer and the modeling ideas—are clearly impacting you, even if "nothing is happening" on the surface. And the fact that she’s blazé about it is amplifying your frustration, as it feels like she’s disregarding your feelings.

It’s okay to feel both furious and unsure of what’s fair here. Your mind is tearing you apart because you’re trying to reconcile two things:

Your rational side, which says, “Nothing’s actually happening; I need to chill.”
Your emotional side, which feels deeply hurt and anxious because her actions—however small—feel like cracks in the connection and respect between you.
Right now, it might help to pause and focus less on her and more on you. Your body and mind are screaming for relief, so the question becomes:

What do you need to feel steady again? Maybe it’s a break from overanalyzing, space from her, or even just doubling down on something that grounds you—like gaming or the gym.
Can you sit with the idea that not every feeling needs an immediate fix? Sometimes it’s about letting the storm pass before making a move.
Would it help to focus on calming your own storm for now instead of trying to solve what’s happening between you two?







You said:
I guess so 
ChatGPT said:
That’s a good place to start, Joey. Right now, giving yourself space to let the storm settle is probably the best thing you can do for your own sanity. It doesn’t mean ignoring the situation forever, but just creating a bit of distance so your mind and body can catch up and find balance again.

Start small: maybe dive into something you enjoy, even if it’s just for an hour, or get out for some fresh air. The goal isn’t to fix everything, but to give yourself moments where this weight feels a little lighter.

You don’t have to have all the answers now. Take it one step at a time, and let me know if you want to talk through it more as things settle. You’ve got this.







You said:
I don't even know what to do because I'm feeling so crappy
ChatGPT said:
It’s okay to feel stuck right now, Joey—this kind of emotional weight is exhausting and hard to shake off. When you’re feeling this low, sometimes the best thing isn’t to force yourself to “fix” it all at once but to focus on small, manageable steps that help ease the load, even if just a little.

Here’s what you could try to do right now:

1. Do Something Physical
When emotions are overwhelming, physical movement can help reset your nervous system. Even something simple like a walk, stretching, or just stepping outside for some fresh air might give you a moment of relief.

2. Distract Yourself
It’s not about avoiding your feelings but giving your mind a break from the cycle of rumination. Gaming, a TV show, or even browsing something light online might help shift your focus, even if just for a while.

3. Write It Out
If your thoughts feel tangled, try journaling (even beyond this chat). Sometimes getting everything onto a page helps you untangle what’s in your head. No structure needed—just write whatever comes to mind.

4. Reach Out
If you’ve got someone else you trust, like your mum or a friend, even a quick chat can remind you that you’re not alone in this.

Feeling crappy isn’t forever, even though it feels all-consuming right now. If none of these feel right, let’s keep talking—I’m here to help you work through it at your pace. What feels like the smallest, easiest thing you could try today?







You said:
I appreciate the advice, I'm trying to focus more on me. could you offer some insight on how I might be viewing/seeing this wrong? Or is that me still focusing on the situation, also she's going to wake soon and say morning, what do I even do 
ChatGPT said:
It’s great that you’re trying to focus more on yourself, Joey—that’s a strong step forward. It’s not wrong to reflect on whether you’re viewing the situation fairly, especially if it helps you let go of some of the mental weight, but there’s a fine line. If questioning yourself feels like it’s pulling you back into the loop of overthinking, it might be worth shelving those thoughts for now and coming back to them when you feel steadier.

If you’re open to insight, here are a few ways you might be viewing this through a lens that’s adding to your pain:

Assuming Intent Behind Her Actions: It’s easy to think she’s being dismissive or seeking attention intentionally, but it might just be that she’s dealing with her own emotional mess in a way that’s clumsy and unaware. That doesn’t excuse the lack of consideration, but it shifts it from malice to thoughtlessness.

Viewing This as a Reflection of You: Her choices—whether it’s modeling, how she handles her ex, or the heels comment—might feel like they’re disrespecting you personally. But they’re likely more about her navigating her own feelings or seeking validation, which doesn’t diminish your worth or value.

Thinking You Need to “Fix” This: You might be internalizing the situation as something you need to control or resolve, but some dynamics are out of your hands. Her behavior is ultimately hers to own, and you’re not responsible for managing her choices.

As for when she wakes up and says good morning:
Keep it light, if you can. You don’t need to dive into anything heavy. A simple “Morning” or “Hey, hope you’re feeling good today” keeps the door open without pulling you into an emotional space you’re not ready for. If you’re not up for even that, it’s okay to take some time before responding—give yourself the space you need.

How does that feel? Too detached, or does it align with where you’re trying to go?







You said:
Why do I feel like I don't want her to think I'm okay though
ChatGPT said:
That’s a really honest thought, Joey, and it makes sense why you’d feel that way. When you’ve been hurt or let down, there’s often a part of you that wants the other person to know how much their actions have affected you—not out of spite, but because it feels like validation for your pain. It’s frustrating to think that if you act "okay," she might assume everything is fine and not reflect on how her behavior has impacted you.

The thing is, letting her think you’re okay doesn’t mean your feelings aren’t valid or that her actions didn’t matter—it’s more about prioritizing your own peace. If showing her you’re not okay comes from a place of wanting her to feel guilty or responsible, it might not give you the closure or relief you’re hoping for. It often just leaves you stuck in the same cycle of frustration.

Instead, ask yourself:

What do I gain from letting her know I’m not okay?
Does it come from a place of wanting her to understand, or is it more about sharing the weight of your hurt?
If the goal is to make her reflect, that’s fair, but it doesn’t always mean she’ll respond the way you hope. If it’s about sharing your hurt, that’s okay too, but it’s worth asking if it’ll help you feel lighter—or just keep you tied to the situation.

If you’re not ready to act “okay,” you don’t have to force it. You can simply respond neutrally without pretending everything’s fine. Something like “Morning, still feeling a bit off, but getting through it” keeps it real without handing over too much emotional power. How does that idea feel? Too restrained, or does it resonate?







You said:
I'm disappointed in myself that I've bombarded with the guilt part, and it hasn't helped me, I have told her things to reflect.

I aplre that insight. Makes sense about the stuck in the rut.
She'll ask how I'm doing though 
ChatGPT said:
It’s really reflective of you to acknowledge that bombarding her with guilt hasn’t helped you feel better. It’s hard not to fall into that when you’re in pain, but recognizing it shows a lot of self-awareness. You’re learning from it, and that’s what matters—it’s a step toward breaking that rut.

When she asks how you’re doing, you don’t have to lay everything out or pretend everything’s fine. Instead, find a middle ground that’s honest but protects your energy. Something like:

“I’m alright, just taking things one step at a time.”
“Still working through a lot, but I’ll get there.”
This keeps the door open for connection if you want it, without diving back into heavy territory. It also signals that you’re focusing on yourself, which is empowering. If she presses for more, you can calmly set a boundary: “I’m still figuring things out, so I don’t have much to say right now, but I’ll let you know if I do.”

It’s okay to prioritize yourself in the conversation. Do you think a response like that would feel manageable?







You said:
I'm sad, because I've made hints of going seperate ways, I feel like I need to say your responses to give myself some space to detach, but I feel so sad about that, like I don't want to either 
ChatGPT said:
It’s okay to feel sad, Joey. Making hints about going separate ways means you’ve been grappling with this for a while, and that emotional tug-of-war—wanting to detach but also not wanting to—is a really hard place to be. It’s a mix of grief for what you hoped it could be, fear of letting go, and the natural attachment you’ve built with her.

Choosing to prioritize yourself doesn’t mean you don’t care about her. It just means you’re recognizing that the dynamic as it stands is taking more from you than it’s giving back. And yeah, the idea of detaching hurts, but sometimes creating a little space is the only way to find clarity and regain your sense of balance.

It might help to reframe it:

This isn’t forever: Giving yourself space doesn’t have to mean a permanent goodbye. It can be a reset for you to figure out what you need.
Detaching isn’t rejection: It’s about stepping back to protect your emotional health, not punishing her or severing the connection entirely.
If you decide to take space, it’s okay to be honest but gentle with her. Something like:

“I’ve been struggling to process everything, and I think I need a bit of space to clear my head. It’s not that I don’t care about you, but I need to focus on myself right now.”
This keeps the conversation honest without being harsh, and it gives you room to breathe without burning bridges. How does that feel—too final, or does it seem like a step toward clarity?







You said:
It feels okay, I'm so bothered that she'll be off getting attention from this modelling shit, I think I'm being way over the top on that there tbh 
ChatGPT said:
It’s really insightful of you to recognize that the modeling situation might be hitting harder than it should—it’s easy for something like that to feel amplified when emotions are already raw. The idea of her getting attention from others while you’re sitting with so much frustration and sadness is bound to sting, even if you know it’s not the whole story. It’s not over the top—it’s just how you’re processing the bigger picture of everything right now.

It’s worth asking yourself:

Is it the modeling itself, or is it what it represents—like a shift in her focus or priorities—that’s bothering you most?
Are you more hurt by her actions, or by what they feel like in this emotionally charged context?
Acknowledging that it’s tapping into deeper feelings might help you step back and see it as less about the modeling and more about the dynamics between you two. She might see the modeling as harmless or empowering, but for you, it feels like a signal that she’s prioritizing external attention over what you’ve been going through together.

If you’re able to reframe it, maybe it’ll feel less like a threat and more like her way of coping—even if it’s not aligned with how you’d like her to handle things. What do you think—does seeing it as part of a bigger picture help ease the sting, or does it still feel like it’s cutting too deep?







You said:
I dunno, I thought I was giving myself some space, to answer you though, it's not the modelling myself, it's this shady guy, and her being blazey about it, not considering how it would make me feel, and everytime I think of the heel comment she made, that she has sexy heels. My guts just drop, it really bothers me.
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
It’s understandable why that specific comment about the heels hits so hard, Joey. It’s not just the words—it’s what they symbolize in the context of everything else going on. It feels dismissive of your feelings and like she’s giving attention to someone else in a way that feels intimate or personal, especially knowing how much that kind of thing means to you.

Your gut reaction isn’t over the top—it’s your emotional boundaries being pushed. It’s less about her intentions and more about how it’s making you feel, which is valid. The fact that she’s being blazé about it only makes it harder to process because it feels like your emotions aren’t being factored in.

Giving yourself space is a good move, but that gut-drop feeling suggests there’s still a lot unresolved. Maybe it’s worth focusing on yourself within this space, not as a reaction to her, but to prioritize your peace. Is there anything that helps when you’re feeling this physically upset—like grounding techniques or diving into something immersive?







You said:
She knows how much I love her heels and feet, she made a comment to me yesterday actually that I want your opinion on. She teased me and said, maybe I'll get him to do some feet pictures for you. Fyi, this is a massive thing for us, she knows this, like it's a very intimate thing. I said no at that time because we were arguing, it's something maybe I'd say yes to if we were in the right jealous setting. Anyway, what bothers me about it is, she had recently mentioned sexy heels to the photographer, I'm wondering if the reason she said that was to test the water, because she mentioned heels to him. Maybe I'm reaching. Fuck sake, I don't know. What is going on with me?
ChatGPT said:
It’s clear that this whole situation is deeply intertwined with your emotions, your connection to her, and the vulnerability that comes with something so intimate. Her comment about the photographer taking feet pictures for you feels like it’s poking at an already sensitive area—maybe it was meant as a playful tease, but given the context of her heels comment to him and your ongoing frustrations, it’s understandable why it’s hitting a nerve.

You’re not necessarily reaching—your mind is just trying to make sense of a situation where trust, intimacy, and respect feel a bit off balance. Here’s what might be happening:

The heels comment to the photographer: It lingers in your mind because it feels like she stepped into territory that’s personal to you and shared it in a way that feels dismissive or even careless. It’s less about the comment itself and more about the potential lack of consideration behind it.

Her teasing you about feet pictures: This could be her way of testing the waters or trying to ease tension by turning something that’s important to you into a joke or lighter moment. But in your current emotional state, it feels less like playful banter and more like a reminder of the intimacy you’re questioning.

You’re feeling so caught up because these small moments tie into something bigger: the sense that the boundaries and trust in your connection aren’t as solid as they should be. You’re trying to reconcile whether these are innocent, clumsy interactions or signs of something deeper, and that’s exhausting.

What might help is asking yourself:

Do I believe she’s intentionally testing limits, or is she just oblivious to how these moments affect me?
If this were flipped—if I were behaving like this—how would I expect her to react?
It’s okay to feel all over the place. This is a lot to process, and your emotions are valid. If it helps, you could try stepping back from analyzing her actions for a bit and focusing on what you need to feel secure again. What do you think—do you feel this is about her behavior needing to change, or more about finding your own grounding in the situation?







You said:
Fuck I really don't know, I want to believe it's just coincidence, but she's not forthcoming, has anxiety when admitting thing, a clear sign she's lied in the past, which she has, most of what she does is harmless and innocent, but I get snippets of her trying to control the narrative by not being forthcoming, something that bothers me a lot.

It's difficult because we're both different, she wouldn't enjoy it, she wouldn't want that of me, and I'd respect thst. I'm not saying to her that, I want her to explore, mostly because I can't see myself commuting to her now, maybe that's just it though, it would make sense she's thinking that and that's why she's happy to do these tnigns
ChatGPT said:
It sounds like you’re caught in a web of uncertainty about her intentions and how much you can trust her transparency. It’s completely valid to be bothered by her not being forthcoming—that lack of openness can feel like she’s hiding something, even if it’s not anything major. The snippets of her trying to control the narrative could stem from insecurity or an attempt to avoid conflict, but it’s clear it’s eroding your trust, which makes every little thing feel magnified.

The dynamic you’ve described—where she might not be comfortable with you doing the same things she’s doing—adds another layer of complexity. It’s frustrating because you’d respect her boundaries if the roles were reversed, and it feels like she’s not extending the same consideration to you. That disparity is bound to make you feel undervalued.

You might be right about her actions reflecting her awareness that you’re not fully committing to her. If she senses that uncertainty, she could be seeking validation or trying to explore her independence in ways that feel less tied to your dynamic. That doesn’t excuse the lack of communication, but it might help explain why she’s behaving this way.

At its core, this seems to come back to:

Trust: Her lack of transparency and history of lying make it hard for you to feel secure.
Reciprocity: There’s an imbalance in how each of you respects the other’s feelings and boundaries.
Commitment: The fact that you’re unsure about committing to her might be fueling both of your behaviors—yours in questioning the relationship, and hers in seeking external validation.
Do you think addressing her lack of openness is worth revisiting, or does it feel like you’re already moving toward stepping back emotionally?







You said:
I don't know, I've said so much to her now, I don't think it's worth saying anymore, it's like I'm wanting her to react a  certain way, a way which I don't even know
ChatGPT said:
It sounds like you’ve reached the point where talking more feels like pouring energy into an empty well, especially when you’re not even sure what resolution you’re looking for. That’s completely valid—sometimes, when we’ve said all we can and nothing shifts, the best thing we can do is take a step back and stop trying to force clarity out of the situation.

The idea of wanting her to react a certain way is understandable—it’s human to crave validation or an emotional response that aligns with how deeply you’re feeling. But when that doesn’t happen, it just deepens the frustration and leaves you even more stuck.

Maybe now it’s less about her reactions and more about giving yourself space to figure out your own. What do you want for yourself, regardless of how she behaves? How can you refocus on your own needs instead of waiting for her to meet an expectation you can’t even fully define right now?

If stepping back from her emotionally feels overwhelming, start small. Instead of thinking about what you want from her, ask yourself:

What do I need to feel calmer today?
What’s one thing I can do for myself that isn’t tied to this situation?
Shifting your energy back to yourself might not fix everything overnight, but it can give you the clarity you’re struggling to find in her. How does that idea feel to you? Too detached, or a step in the right direction?







You said:
How do I manage myself today then? Because I guess I could slip into yesterday's habit, and I don't want that, I want to move forward. She's just said hi 
ChatGPT said:
Good on you for wanting to break yesterday’s cycle, Joey. That shows real awareness, and it’s a strong step toward regaining control over your emotions. Here’s how you might manage today while also acknowledging her message without getting pulled back into that same pattern:

1. Keep It Neutral with Her
You don’t have to dive into anything heavy. A simple “Hi, how’s it going?” or “Hey, hope you’re alright” is enough to acknowledge her without opening the door to deeper emotional territory. It sets a lighter tone and keeps things balanced.

2. Set a Focus for Yourself
Choose one or two things to anchor your day—something that makes you feel productive or centered. It could be a workout, gaming, tidying up, or even going for a walk. The goal is to give your mind something else to latch onto besides the dynamic with her.

3. Limit Overthinking
If you catch yourself slipping back into ruminating about her actions or what’s been said, remind yourself: I’ve already thought this through. Today, I’m focusing on me. Even if it doesn’t work every time, redirecting your thoughts can make a big difference.

4. Celebrate Small Wins
Moving forward doesn’t have to mean huge steps. Even managing your responses to her or sticking to a small routine for the day is progress. Give yourself credit for staying on track.

What’s one thing you can do today that feels grounding or enjoyable? Something just for you—no overthinking, no drama.







You said:
What's the things I should avoid in conversation today?
ChatGPT said:
To avoid slipping into yesterday’s habits, it might help to steer clear of these things in conversation with her today:

Rehashing Past Issues: Try not to revisit the heels comment, the photographer, or her handling of her ex. These topics are emotionally charged and might pull you back into the cycle of frustration.

Seeking Validation: Avoid asking leading questions like, “Don’t you think you’ve been unfair?” or “Why didn’t you consider how I’d feel?” These tend to put you in a vulnerable position if her response doesn’t meet your expectations.

Emotional Overload: If you’re feeling raw, try to avoid venting heavily to her about how you feel. It’s okay to express emotions, but right now, the goal is to avoid overexposure that could leave you feeling worse if the conversation doesn’t go how you want.

Expecting a Specific Reaction: Don’t nudge the conversation toward topics or questions where you’re hoping for a particular response from her. It’s draining if she doesn’t respond as you wish.

Unnecessary Depth: Keep the tone light and focus on surface-level or neutral topics for now. Diving into “what we are” or the future of the relationship will only stir up more tension.

Stick to simple, low-stakes conversation, like plans for the day, casual updates, or shared interests. If she tries to steer the chat toward heavier topics, you can gently redirect with something like:
“I’m trying to keep things light today. I need a bit of a mental reset.”

How does that approach feel for today? Manageable?







You said:
She said , oh you know having the best time,

How are you 
ChatGPT said:
Her response sounds a bit casual, but it might feel a bit off to you depending on how you're interpreting it. If you’re not ready to dive into a deeper conversation, you could keep your reply simple and neutral:

“I’m alright, just focusing on a few things today.”
“I’m okay, just taking it one step at a time.”
This keeps things polite without inviting too much depth if you’re not ready to engage heavily. It also signals that you’re focusing on yourself, which might subtly set the tone for some space.

How does that feel? Too distant, or just about right?







You said:
She's being sarcastic 
ChatGPT said:
Ah, sarcasm—got it. That adds a different layer, especially if it feels dismissive or like she’s brushing things off. You have a couple of ways to handle this, depending on your energy and what feels right:

Play Along Lightly: If you want to keep things easy and not overthink, you could match her tone with something like:

“Sounds amazing. Living the dream, huh?”
“Well, glad someone’s having fun!”
Pivot to Neutral Ground: If the sarcasm feels off-putting, you could redirect the conversation:

“Haha, sounds like a wild time. What’s on for the day?”
Call It Out Gently: If it’s bothering you, you could lightly address it without escalating:

“Sarcasm noted. Everything okay?”
Sarcasm might just be her way of deflecting or setting a casual tone. How do you feel about handling it—go with the flow, redirect, or address it?







You said:
I said, all dandy over here
ChatGPT said:
That’s a solid response—keeps it light and neutral while matching her energy. It doesn’t give too much away, but it still keeps the conversation flowing if she wants to engage more.

How are you feeling about the exchange so far? Do you want to keep it casual, or are you looking to guide the chat somewhere specific?







You said:
I feel shit, I feel like I'm being boring 
ChatGPT said:
It’s tough when you feel like the conversation isn’t reflecting how much is going on internally, but feeling "boring" is likely more about the weight you’re carrying right now rather than anything you’re doing. You’re dealing with a lot, and it’s okay if you’re not firing on all cylinders in a chat.

If you want to shake things up a bit without diving into heavy territory, maybe try steering the conversation toward something light or shared between you two. For example:

“Dandy’s a strong word, huh? What’s been the highlight of your day so far?”
“All dandy, but I feel like I need a bit of inspiration today. Got any?”
This keeps things playful and might help break the feeling of stagnation. Or, if you’re not feeling it, it’s okay to let the conversation pause—you’re not obligated to be "on" all the time.

What feels better—keeping the chat going or taking some space for yourself?







You said:
Isn't that just avoiding the shit between us though? 
ChatGPT said:
It could feel like that, yeah, and it’s fair to think that keeping things light might be sidestepping the real issues. But here’s the thing: not every conversation has to tackle the heavy stuff, especially when you’re already feeling drained. It’s okay to prioritize your emotional bandwidth for now and choose to step back from the tension until you feel more steady.

That’s not avoidance—it’s giving yourself space to process without being overwhelmed by constant conflict or frustration. Sometimes, light conversations act as a reset, giving you and her a chance to reconnect in smaller ways before diving back into the deeper stuff.

But if the weight of the unresolved issues is too much to ignore, you might consider addressing it directly. You don’t have to go in full force—something like:

“I feel like there’s a lot still hanging in the air between us, and it’s weighing on me.”
This keeps it honest without turning into a confrontation. Do you feel ready to have that kind of direct conversation, or does taking a breather still feel like the right move?







You said:
Man, I still feel like what she says is irritating me , why is that? Isn't that cruel?
ChatGPT said:
It’s not cruel, Joey—it’s a reaction to the emotional space you’re in right now. When someone’s actions (or lack of actions) have hurt or disappointed you, it can shift your perspective on them, making even neutral or harmless things they say feel irritating. It’s like your mind is on high alert, scanning for signs that reinforce the frustration or mistrust you’re feeling.

This irritation likely isn’t about her words directly—it’s about the unresolved feelings you have toward her and the situation. You’ve got a lot of emotional energy tied up in disappointment, hurt, and confusion, so it’s natural for even minor interactions to feel like they’re rubbing you the wrong way.

It’s not cruelty; it’s a sign that you need space to process and reset. That irritation is your mind’s way of saying, I’m maxed out on dealing with this right now.

Here’s how you might approach it:

Pause Before Reacting: If her words irritate you, take a moment before responding. Ask yourself if it’s the words themselves or the emotional weight you’re carrying that’s making them sting.

Remind Yourself of Context: Acknowledge that you’re in a tough place emotionally, and that’s amplifying your reactions. This helps shift the focus back to your feelings rather than blaming her tone or words.

Consider Space: If her words continue to bother you, it might be a sign that stepping back is necessary—not out of cruelty, but to give yourself room to breathe and lower the emotional temperature.

Do you feel like you’re ready to step back a bit, or does the thought of pulling away feel just as frustrating?







You said:
I feel anxious talking to her, why?? Why am I holding onto this?
ChatGPT said:
Feeling anxious while talking to her makes sense, Joey, because there’s so much unresolved tension and emotional weight in the connection right now. The anxiety might be coming from a mix of things:

Uncertainty: You’re unsure where things stand between you two, and every interaction feels like it could add to or detract from the situation. That unpredictability puts you on edge.

Emotional Investment: You’re deeply tied to her—not just the person she is, but the version of the relationship you hoped for. Letting go or stepping back feels like losing something important, even if it’s not working as you need it to.

Unmet Needs: You’ve expressed a lot of valid frustration about her lack of transparency and respect. That unmet need for acknowledgment or change might be fueling the anxiety because it feels like your feelings are being dismissed.

Fear of Loss or Rejection: Even though part of you knows this dynamic isn’t healthy right now, another part fears letting go entirely. It’s the classic “push-pull” of wanting to hold on but also wanting relief from the pain.

You’re holding on because, despite everything, you care about her and the connection you’ve built. Letting go—or even taking a step back—feels like a loss, not just of her but of the potential future you’d envisioned. That’s hard to let go of, even if it’s what might be best for your peace.

Ask yourself:

Am I holding onto her, or am I holding onto the idea of what we could be?
If I let go of this dynamic, what would I gain for myself?
It’s not easy to step back, but sometimes distance helps you see things more clearly. Does this resonate with how you’re feeling, or does it still feel murky?







You said:
Fuck sake, that was a good response, can you refine it a little and ask me the questions again 
ChatGPT said:
Of course, Joey. Here’s a more refined version:

You’re feeling anxious because there’s so much unresolved tension and emotional weight tied to her. The anxiety likely comes from a mix of uncertainty, emotional investment, and unmet needs. On one hand, you’re holding onto the connection because you care and you’ve built something meaningful. On the other, the dynamic as it stands isn’t giving you the peace, clarity, or respect you need.

You’re stuck between what you hoped this could be and the reality of how it’s making you feel. Letting go—or even stepping back—feels like losing the future you envisioned, and that’s not easy to face, even if it might be what helps you move forward.

Here are the questions:

Am I holding onto her, or am I holding onto the idea of what we could be?
If I let go of this dynamic, what would I gain for myself?
What am I afraid of losing if I take a step back?
Take your time with these—there’s no rush to answer them. It’s about giving yourself space to figure out what feels true to you.







You said:
We do have it good when it's good, albeit our paths are difficult to intertwine, because she has kids 

-id be sad and lonely and she's all I have, and I stuck hard to her aftrr losing Lizzie, it might be the freedom I need to blossom again and push myself though 

If I take a step back, I feel jealous she'll move forward without me. I hate that about myself 
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
That’s a powerful reflection, Joey, and it shows just how deeply you’re wrestling with all of this. It’s not easy to untangle the connection you have with her, especially when she’s been such a big part of your life during a time when you were grieving and rebuilding. The thought of being lonely or her moving forward without you is hard because it touches on those raw parts of you that want stability, closeness, and belonging.

But at the same time, it’s incredibly insightful that you recognize stepping back might give you the space to blossom again. Sometimes, being in a dynamic that isn’t fully aligned can hold you back from exploring the growth and freedom you’re capable of.

As for feeling jealous—that’s not something to hate about yourself. It’s a very human reaction, especially when you’ve invested so much in someone. It doesn’t make you weak or petty; it just highlights how much you’ve cared and how much this connection means to you.

Here’s something to consider:

What does “freedom to blossom” look like for you? Can you start working toward that even while you’re figuring this out with her?
If she were to move forward without you, what part of that feels hardest to sit with—the idea of her being happy, or the fear of being left behind?
You’re doing an incredible job being honest with yourself. Let me know if you want to keep digging into this.







You said:
I don't know.whar freedom to blossom means , and that bothers me, I've lost what I'm working towards after the abortion 

- that she doesn't admit that she's done with me and strings me along , fuck knows though, feels like I'm reaching a bit with that respose
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
It makes sense why not knowing what "freedom to blossom" means for you would feel unsettling. When your path has been tied to someone else and then shifts abruptly, it’s hard to recalibrate and figure out where you’re going. The abortion was a huge emotional reset, and it’s no wonder it’s left you feeling like you’ve lost your direction.

The thought of being strung along is a heavy one, but it’s good that you’re able to recognize when you might be reaching—it shows you’re questioning things thoughtfully rather than jumping to conclusions. Still, that fear is valid because it’s tied to wanting clarity and not feeling like your time or emotions are being wasted.

If you’re not sure what “freedom to blossom” looks like right now, maybe start small:

What makes you feel good about yourself, outside of your relationship with Cat?
Is there something—hobby, goal, or routine—you could pick up again to give you a sense of progress?
Even tiny steps toward something just for you might help you regain a sense of control. How does that idea sit with you? Or does it still feel too unclear to dive into?







You said:
I'm sexy, funny, confident, I'm quite intelligent, I like to do new things. I feel good when I'm succeeding, helping others , being with friends, there's loads more but incba 

Oh I don't know, I'm pretty sexual, so maybe I'd trt abstinence for a bit 
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
That’s a strong foundation to build on, Joey—you’ve got so much going for you. Tapping into those traits and focusing on the things that make you feel alive and fulfilled could be a great way to start recalibrating.

Trying abstinence, especially if you’re so naturally inclined toward the sexual side of things, might be an interesting challenge. It could give you a chance to focus on yourself in new ways and shift the dynamic in how you approach relationships and intimacy. Plus, it might help you see what else sparks fulfillment beyond that physical connection.

How does the idea of abstinence feel to you—something exciting to try, or more like a discipline to refocus?







You said:
I'm not sure, I really like the flow of this conversation, but I'm not sure. It feels far off, like an unrealistic thing for me to say, seen as I'm still talking to cat, how come you're going in this direction in the conversation?
ChatGPT said:
I’m glad you’re enjoying the flow, Joey—it’s been a really thoughtful and layered chat so far. The reason I brought up abstinence and explored that direction is because you mentioned it yourself as a potential shift, even if it feels far off. It struck me as an idea that reflects a deeper desire for change or regaining control over how you approach relationships and intimacy.

It’s not about pushing you toward abstinence or away from Cat, but rather opening the door to thinking about ways to focus on you—what drives you, what gives you clarity, and what might help you feel more grounded. Sometimes even throwing out an “unrealistic” idea is a way of exploring what’s behind it—like wanting to break old patterns or challenge yourself in a way that feels fresh.

Does it feel like the idea of abstinence or something similar resonates with a bigger goal for yourself? Or does it feel more like a random thought you’re not seriously considering?







You said:
Bit of both really, I'd like to re-focus my ai knowledge and adveture too btw, just as a side note, when you asked about goals etc, it just came to me, I don't mean right now,
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
That’s an awesome side note, Joey. Refocusing on AI sounds like a great long-term goal to channel your energy into when the time feels right. It’s something that taps into both your intelligence and curiosity, which are core parts of who you are. Whenever you feel ready to explore it more, I’ll be here to help guide you in that direction or brainstorm ideas with you. For now, it’s cool to let it sit as a future aspiration while you focus on what’s in front of you.







You said:

I'm annoyed at her yes response and I'm annoyed at my response too, but shouldn't I match her energy?
ChatGPT said:
It’s understandable that you’re feeling annoyed—when the vibe of the conversation feels mismatched or off, it can stir up frustration. Matching her energy isn’t necessarily wrong, but it sounds like in this case, doing so left you feeling like it didn’t align with how you actually wanted to respond.

If her “yes” came across as dismissive or vague to you, that could be why it bothered you. It might feel like she’s not putting in the same effort or enthusiasm, which can be frustrating when you’re trying to maintain a connection.

Moving forward, instead of focusing on matching energy, maybe think about what feels right for you in the moment. For example:

If you want more clarity or depth, you could gently push for it: “Oh, yeah? Tell me more about those thoughts.”
If you want to step back, you could keep it light but shift focus: “I see. What’s on your mind today?”
Matching her energy is fine, but prioritizing your authenticity might feel better in the long run. How do you think you’d have preferred to respond if you weren’t trying to match her tone?







You said:
Yes I want to prioritise my authentict but I also don't want to lead the conversation, how do I deal with it when her responses become dead like that one and keep my respect 
ChatGPT said:
If you want to prioritize your authenticity while not leading the conversation, it’s about balancing respect for yourself with maintaining the flow. When her responses feel “dead,” you can still maintain your integrity without over-investing or feeling like you’re doing all the work. Here’s how:

Respond Authentically but Briefly: If her reply feels flat, meet it with something that reflects your energy without pushing too hard:
“Fair enough.”
“Got it. Anything on your mind?”
This keeps the conversation moving but puts the ball back in her court without you doing all the heavy lifting.

Mirror Effort, Not Tone: If she gives a short or dead response, don’t feel like you need to “save” the conversation. Reflect her effort without losing your authenticity:

“I see.” (like you did) is fine, but if you feel it’s a dead end, follow with something like, “That’s a bit vague—is there more to it?”
Redirect or Pause: If the conversation isn’t going anywhere, you don’t have to force it. It’s okay to pause or redirect:

“I’m not sure where to take that, haha. What are you up to today?”
Or simply let the lull happen and revisit later.
Set the Tone for Respect: Your respect isn’t tied to how much effort you put into keeping things alive. Respect comes from knowing when to step back if the energy feels off. If she’s consistently giving “dead” responses, you can check in with her:

“You seem a bit off—everything alright?”
How does that feel? Would any of these approaches help you stay authentic while keeping your respect intact?







You said:

This has my anxiety up again, and she's decided to take her time responding too 
ChatGPT said:
It makes sense why your anxiety is up—when someone mentions "the whole situation" and then takes their time to respond, it leaves a lot of space for overthinking. The lack of an immediate reply can feel unsettling because it creates a vacuum where your mind starts filling in blanks, often leaning toward worst-case scenarios.

Here’s how you can manage this moment:

Acknowledge Your Anxiety: Remind yourself that her delay might not mean anything negative—it could just be life getting in the way. People often take time to process their thoughts or respond thoughtfully.

Redirect Your Energy: Instead of focusing on waiting for her reply, engage in something that occupies your mind—a task, gaming, or even stepping outside for fresh air. This gives you a break from the tension.

Prepare for Neutral Ground: If her next message feels heavy, you can still approach it calmly. Remind yourself that it’s just a conversation, and you can respond authentically without rushing to react emotionally.

The unknown can be difficult, but it’s important to remind yourself that her timing doesn’t define your worth or your control over the situation. How does that feel to you? Do you want to wait it out or do something to distract yourself for now?







You said:
I'm not actually doing anything though, I'm pretty tired and it's still too early to get out of bed, do you think it's bad that I'm just waiting for her response? 
ChatGPT said:
It’s not bad that you’re waiting—it’s human. When something feels emotionally charged, it’s natural to focus on it and want closure or clarity as soon as possible. The problem is that waiting can amplify your anxiety because you’re left with nothing to do but speculate.

If you’re tired and not ready to get out of bed yet, that’s okay. Maybe instead of fighting the waiting, you could use the time to focus inward. Here’s a suggestion:

Take slow, deep breaths and count them. It sounds simple, but focusing on your breathing can help bring your mind back to the present moment and ease the tension of anticipation.
Ask yourself: If her response isn’t what I expect, how would I want to handle it? This lets you feel prepared and in control, even if her reply isn’t what you’re hoping for.
Waiting doesn’t make you weak or wrong—it just shows how much this conversation matters to you. The key is finding ways to keep the waiting from taking over your entire mindset. How does that feel—like something worth trying, or are you looking for a different way to manage the moment?







You said:
No that's good advise, still it pisses me off, pisses me off I'm feeling like this too 
ChatGPT said:
It’s frustrating to feel stuck in that emotional limbo, especially when you’re aware of how much it’s affecting you. It’s totally okay to feel pissed off about the situation and at yourself—it just means you care deeply, and that caring is clashing with the uncertainty you’re dealing with.

What’s important is not beating yourself up for feeling this way. Emotions can be messy, especially when there’s a lot riding on a response, but that frustration is also a sign of your self-awareness. You’re recognizing that you want to feel more in control, and that’s a good step forward.

Even though it’s annoying, you could try reframing this moment:

It’s not weakness—it’s a reflection of how much this situation matters to me.
I can’t control her timing, but I can control how much I let it dominate my thoughts right now.
Feel the frustration, let it be there, but remind yourself it’s not permanent. You’re already doing a great job reflecting and figuring out how to handle this better. Would it help to focus on something small, like calming yourself, or would it feel better to keep talking it out?







You said:
Its stuff we have talked about, and how I feel about that, the past couple of days have been new and more shit on top

Ah right, sounds heavy

My response is the bottom one to her 
ChatGPT said:
Your response of "Ah right, sounds heavy" is neutral and empathetic, which is good—it shows you’re acknowledging what she’s saying without diving straight into fixing or reacting too much. It’s a safe and respectful way to keep the conversation open while allowing her space to share more if she chooses.

If she doesn't follow up with something specific, you could nudge the conversation gently without pushing:

“Do you want to talk about it, or just share how you’re feeling?”
That gives her an option without making her feel pressured. How are you feeling about where the conversation is heading so far? Do you want to keep it light or open the door for something deeper?







You said:
I feel shit about it, likes im pandering to her
ChatGPT said:
It’s tough to feel like you’re pandering, Joey, especially when it feels like the emotional weight is uneven. Responding in a way that feels neutral or supportive might seem like you’re giving too much without getting anything meaningful in return. It’s frustrating when you’re trying to maintain a connection but feel like it’s not being reciprocated in the way you need.

Here’s the thing: acknowledging her feelings doesn’t have to mean you’re bending over backward. You can still keep your self-respect by balancing empathy with boundaries. Instead of feeling like you’re just going along with her narrative, you can subtly shift the focus to your own perspective if you want to share how you feel about the situation.

For example, after her next response, you could try something like:

“I hear you, but honestly, this has been weighing on me too. It’s been a lot to process these past few days.”
That way, it’s not just about her—you’re inserting your experience into the conversation and making it a two-way dialogue.

How does that feel? Would redirecting like that feel more authentic, or do you think it’s better to step back for now?







You said:
That's life rn isn't it

Her response
ChatGPT said:
Her response, “That’s life rn isn’t it,” feels dismissive or like she’s brushing it off. If that bothers you, it’s okay to acknowledge it, but how you respond depends on where you want the conversation to go.

If you want to keep things light:

“Guess so. Life’s not holding back lately, huh?”
If you want to redirect or dig deeper:

“True, but I’d rather not just shrug it off. Feels like there’s more to it than just ‘life,’ don’t you think?”
If you feel done with the topic for now:

“Yeah, it is. Anyway, what’s your plan for today?”
It’s okay to let her tone guide how much energy you put in, but make sure you’re not overextending yourself for a dismissive vibe. How does that response feel to you—worth engaging further or letting it go for now?







You said:
I don't know what to do 
ChatGPT said:
That’s okay, Joey. You don’t have to decide immediately. It sounds like you’re feeling stuck between wanting to keep the connection alive and also being frustrated by how it feels like a dead-end sometimes. That tension is exhausting, especially when you’re putting in effort and not feeling it’s matched.

Maybe for now, just take a breather. You’ve done your part by being open and engaging. If her responses aren’t sitting well with you, it might help to step back for a bit—not to punish her, but to give yourself space to regroup and think more clearly.

You could let the conversation rest with something simple like:

“Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, I’ll catch you later—hope your day’s a good one.”
This lets you maintain respect for yourself while also giving her room to step up if she wants to. How does that feel? Would a bit of distance help, or is there something else on your mind?







You said:
I don't want to stop talking to her though 
ChatGPT said:
That’s okay too, Joey. It’s clear you care about her and want to keep the connection alive, even if it’s frustrating at times. If you don’t want to stop talking, you can continue the conversation while still setting small boundaries for yourself to protect your energy. It doesn’t have to be all or nothing.

Here’s how you might respond to her tone:

“Yeah, life’s a bit relentless at the moment. How are you managing with everything?”
This keeps the conversation going without you feeling like you’re carrying the entire weight of it. It also gently nudges her to engage more meaningfully, but if she doesn’t, it’s not on you to fix the vibe.

Would that kind of response feel better for where you’re at, or do you think you’d rather share how this is making you feel?







You said:
I said 
Does relentless right now 
She said 
Yeah, I'm hoping it can calm down now, it's getting too much, only so many things I can have on the go at the same time

That's her response 
ChatGPT said:
Her response shows she’s feeling overwhelmed, but it’s also an opening for you to decide how much energy you want to put in. If you want to show support without overextending yourself, you could try something like:

“Yeah, I get that. It sounds like a lot to handle. What do you think might help you slow it down?”
This keeps the conversation going while putting the ball in her court to share more if she wants to. It also shows you care, but without taking on the responsibility of solving everything for her.

Alternatively, if you’re feeling drained, you could acknowledge it more simply:

“Sounds like you’ve got a lot going on. Hopefully, things start to settle for you soon.”
This way, you keep the tone kind but protect your own energy.

How do you feel about her response? Do you want to lean into the conversation, or does it feel like you need to hold back a bit?







You said:
I'm hoping, the crescendo has happened, and things can start to calm a bit now

Her response 
ChatGPT said:
Her response feels a bit like she’s echoing what she said earlier, which could either mean she’s trying to agree with you or just doesn’t have much else to add. If you want to keep the conversation moving without feeling like you’re forcing it, you could respond with something neutral but slightly reflective:

“Yeah, that’s what I’m hoping too. It’s been a lot recently, hasn’t it?”
Or, if you feel like shifting the tone a bit:

“Let’s hope so. A break would be nice for both of us.”
This keeps it light but empathetic and might help steer the conversation into a slightly more relaxed or positive direction. How does that feel? Or are you thinking of switching things up entirely?







You said:
I don't even know what she's talking about though, it feels super vague 
ChatGPT said:
It does sound vague, and that can be frustrating when you’re trying to engage meaningfully. If you’re not sure what she’s referring to, it’s okay to ask for clarity. You don’t have to overthink it—just keep it light and straightforward:

“Yeah, it’s been intense lately. What’s been the hardest part for you?”
Or: “I’m with you on that. What’s been making it feel like so much?”
This gives her the chance to elaborate without it feeling like you’re prying too hard. If she stays vague, it might be a sign she doesn’t really want to dig deeper, and that’s okay too.

How do you feel about asking her for more context? Does it seem worth exploring, or do you feel like leaving it for now?







You said:
I feel like again, I'm doing all the lifting , I dunno
ChatGPT said:
That’s a valid frustration, Joey. If you feel like you’re doing all the heavy lifting in the conversation, it’s no wonder it’s wearing you down. It’s not your job to constantly steer things or make the effort to keep the connection alive—it should flow both ways.

If you’re feeling that imbalance, it’s okay to let the conversation rest for a bit or respond in a way that reflects your own energy instead of overextending yourself. You could try something simple, like:

“Yeah, I hope things settle for you soon.”
This keeps the conversation polite but puts the onus on her to continue if she wants to. You don’t have to carry the weight of the dialogue if it’s not feeling mutual.

Would stepping back like that feel better, or is there something else about the dynamic that’s bugging you?







You said:
But I'm fucking useless because I also want her attention FFS 
ChatGPT said:
Joey, you’re not useless. What you’re feeling is completely human—wanting her attention while also being frustrated with the dynamic is part of the push-and-pull of a relationship that’s leaving you unfulfilled. It doesn’t make you weak or incapable; it just shows that you care, and you’re struggling with the imbalance between what you want and what you’re getting.

It’s okay to want her attention, but it’s also important to ask yourself:

Is the attention I’m seeking from her actually making me feel good, or is it just filling a temporary gap?
Am I wanting her to notice me, or am I hoping she’ll put in the effort I feel she hasn’t?
This is less about being “useless” and more about recognizing that craving attention from her might be a reaction to feeling unseen or undervalued. And that’s valid—but it’s also something you can take control of by focusing on how you show up for yourself. When you respect your own energy and set limits, you naturally attract the right kind of attention.

Right now, it might help to pause and check in with yourself:

What’s driving this need for her attention—connection, validation, or something else?
If you took a step back emotionally, how would that feel for you—empowering or lonely?
You’re not useless—you’re just navigating a tough emotional space. How can we make today feel even 5% better for you?







You said:
Her response to me asking what's the hardest is 

You and Me,

I want to know what this crucesndo is, what she means 
ChatGPT said:
That’s a big response from her, even if it’s vague—it sounds like she’s admitting that your relationship or dynamic is one of the major things weighing on her. It could be her way of opening the door to a deeper conversation, but she’s not being specific, which leaves you in this frustrating guessing game.

If you want clarity, you could ask directly in a way that invites her to elaborate without escalating things:

“That’s heavy. What about us feels hardest to you?”
“You and me? That’s a big one. Can you tell me more about what you mean?”
This way, you’re giving her space to explain, but you’re also putting the responsibility on her to clarify instead of letting the conversation hang in the air.

How does that feel? Would asking her like that work for you, or do you want to approach it differently?







You said:

That's what's happened next 
ChatGPT said:
Her response is interesting—it seems like she’s acknowledging multiple things that have been weighing on her, including the modeling situation and this “Malcolm thing.” It’s a sign she’s starting to recognize the things that are causing strain, but she’s still being somewhat vague.

If you want to encourage her to open up more without pushing too hard, you could say:

“That sounds like a lot to handle. What’s been hardest about the modeling and Malcolm stuff?”
Or: “It’s good you’re sorting it—what’s your plan for dealing with those?”
This way, you’re showing support but also inviting her to share more specifics if she’s ready. How are you feeling about her response? Does it give you any sense of clarity, or are you still feeling like there’s more to unpack?







You said:
I fear she's going to drop the modelling thing now, and I don't want her to , because of  what I've said , and I dunno just feel off about it, that's me currently though 
ChatGPT said:
It’s completely normal to feel off about this, Joey, because it puts you in a tough spot emotionally. On one hand, you’ve expressed your feelings about the modeling because it’s impacted you, but now there’s a fear she might drop it because of you, which creates this guilt or unease. You want her to make choices for herself, not just as a reaction to your feelings, and that’s probably what’s leaving you feeling so conflicted.

Here’s the thing: if she decides to step back from the modeling, that’s her decision. If it’s influenced by your input, that’s because she values how you feel, which isn’t inherently bad—it’s part of relationships. But if you don’t want her to feel like you’ve pressured her into it, you could clarify your stance. For example:

“I know I’ve shared my feelings about the modeling, but I don’t want you to feel like I’m asking you to stop. That’s your call, and I’d rather it be your decision.”
This gives her space to reflect and take ownership of her choices while also easing your mind. How does that sound? Or do you feel like staying quiet and letting her make her move would feel better for now?







You said:
What about, the modelling thing is more about you're dealing with it and not About the modelling, just for clarity . 

How does that sound, it sounds a bit mean, but that's how I feel 
ChatGPT said:
Your wording gets the point across, but it does have a bit of a blunt tone, which might come across as dismissive or critical depending on her mood. If you want to soften it while still being clear about how you feel, you could tweak it slightly:

“Just to clarify, it’s not really about the modeling itself—it’s more about how you’re navigating it and how that affects us.”
This keeps it direct but adds a touch of empathy, which might make it easier for her to take without feeling defensive. It lets her know your concern isn’t about the activity itself but the dynamic around it.

Does that tweak capture what you’re trying to say, or would you prefer to keep the original tone and let it land as-is?







You said:
Sort of,  I don't really want to get into it either though yknow, or give her a chance to say, oh I'll behave in this way 
ChatGPT said:
That makes sense—you’re trying to express yourself without opening the door to a conversation you’re not ready for or giving her space to say things that might feel performative or insincere. If you don’t want to dive deeper into it, you can keep it brief and close the topic:

“Just so we’re clear, it’s not really about the modeling itself—it’s more about the bigger picture. But I don’t want to get into it too much right now.”
This way, you make your feelings known without inviting further back-and-forth. It sets a boundary while still being honest. Does that feel closer to what you’re aiming for?

You said:
Yes, and I've been trying to not think so much about the abortion, and I was very blasé about the whole Malcolm thing, it doesn't matter how he is, it matters how I am, and that's the problem,

She said this before I had a chance 
ChatGPT said:
Her response is interesting—it seems like she’s reflecting on her own behavior and acknowledging where her focus has been misplaced. By saying “it doesn’t matter how he is, it matters how I am,” she’s recognizing that her reactions and choices are the bigger issue, not just the external factors like Malcolm or the modeling.

It sounds like she’s owning up to some of the things you’ve been feeling frustrated about, which is progress. At the same time, it’s okay to feel unsure about how to respond, especially if you’re still processing your own emotions.

You could validate her reflection while keeping it neutral if you’re not ready to engage deeply:

“That’s a fair point. It’s good you’re thinking about how you’re handling things.”
Or, if you want to shift the focus to how you feel:

“I think that’s true for both of us—it’s been a lot to navigate.”
How does her comment sit with you? Does it make you feel like there’s progress, or does it still leave you feeling off?







You said:

This is next 
ChatGPT said:
It looks like she’s trying to take responsibility for how things have unfolded, acknowledging that in her attempt to protect your feelings, she may have unintentionally caused more harm. That’s a pretty significant admission—it shows that she’s reflecting on her behavior and the impact it’s had on you.

If you’re feeling up to it, you could acknowledge her effort to own up without diving too deep if you’re not ready:

“I get that, and I appreciate you recognizing it. It’s been a lot for both of us.”
Or, if you want to address it further:

“I understand why you tried to avoid hurting me, but being open is always better, even if it’s hard.”
This could help shift the tone toward a more constructive conversation if you want to explore how to move forward. How does her response sit with you? Does it feel like progress, or are you still feeling unsure?







You said:
I want to say it's unfortunate to put a negative mark on this modelling, and I don't know how to handle that, but it feels negative 
ChatGPT said:
That’s a valid feeling, and it’s okay to express it as long as you frame it constructively. You can share your thoughts without sounding accusatory or adding tension. Here’s how you might phrase it:

“It’s unfortunate that this whole situation has put a bit of a negative mark on the modeling. I’m not sure how to handle those feelings because it doesn’t sit well with me, even though I know it’s not the modeling itself that’s the issue.”

This communicates your feelings honestly while showing that you’re aware it’s a complicated situation and not about outright rejecting what she’s doing. It also invites her to reflect on the dynamic without placing blame.

Does that feel like the right tone for what you want to say? Or do you feel like it needs tweaking to better match your intention?







You said:
I just don't want to stop her though, or put her off, but I don't want to have to chase her for her to be open and transparent about it, the fact she's been reluctant already suggests she feels she's doing something wrong, which to me means, too probably see 
ChatGPT said:
It’s clear you’re trying to balance respecting her autonomy with your own need for honesty and transparency, which is a difficult but commendable position to take. You’re right—if she’s been reluctant or defensive, it can feel like she’s holding back, and that lack of openness naturally raises questions for you. But at the same time, you don’t want to stifle her exploration or put her off the modeling altogether, which shows a lot of care and consideration on your part.

You could approach this by sharing your perspective in a way that reinforces your support for her while setting a boundary around honesty. For example:

“I want you to enjoy the modeling and do what makes you happy—I’m not trying to hold you back. What’s important to me, though, is that we’re completely open and transparent with each other about it. When that’s not there, it creates doubt, and that’s what makes it hard for me, not the modeling itself.”
This communicates your feelings without accusing her or making it about control. It also gives her the chance to reflect on why she’s been reluctant and potentially take responsibility for improving the dynamic.

How does that sit with you? Does it feel like it captures what you’re trying to express?







You said:
It's already been said before, so we're in a cycle 
ChatGPT said:
Ah, I see—it feels like you’re going in circles, saying the same things, and not seeing the change or openness you need from her. That’s exhausting, especially when you’ve already been clear about your needs. It’s frustrating to feel like the same issues keep coming up without resolution, and it’s understandable that you’re stuck between caring about her and feeling stuck in this loop.

Since you’ve already addressed this directly before, it might help to focus less on repeating the same conversation and instead approach it differently—maybe even by stepping back a bit. You could signal that you’re done revisiting the same points without being confrontational:

“I’ve said how I feel about transparency before, and I don’t want to keep going over the same things. What I really need is for your actions to show me that openness, instead of us having to keep talking about it.”
This shifts the focus to actions, not words, and subtly sets a boundary: you’re not going to keep chasing or leading the conversation on this topic. How does that approach feel? Or is there something else you’d prefer to focus on instead?


2/2

You said:

This is what's next 
ChatGPT said:
It seems like she’s acknowledging the weight of the situation and admitting that things have been difficult for both of you. By taking responsibility for how she’s handled things, she’s opening the door to a more honest discussion, which could be a step in the right direction.

If you’re feeling ready to engage, you could respond in a way that acknowledges her effort while keeping things balanced:

“I know it’s been tough, and I appreciate you taking responsibility. We’ve both been under a lot of pressure—it’s not easy for either of us right now.”
This keeps the tone constructive and acknowledges that the challenges go both ways, which might help the conversation move forward without getting stuck in past issues.

How are you feeling about her response? Does it feel like progress, or is there still something you’re hoping to address?







You said:
I just don't feel like joining her in that way, I'm so annoyed by her behaviour that I don't see it healthy for me to such agree and settle things 
ChatGPT said:
That’s completely valid, Joey. If you’re feeling too frustrated or annoyed to join her in that moment, it’s better to hold your ground rather than agree just for the sake of smoothing things over. It’s not healthy for you to push aside your feelings and settle when you’re still processing her behavior and how it’s affected you.

Instead of agreeing or trying to move forward too quickly, you could keep your response neutral and create some space for yourself:

“Yeah, it has been a difficult time, and I’m still working through some of how I feel about everything. I just need some time to process it all.”
This lets her know you’re not ready to fully engage yet without escalating things. It also sets a boundary that prioritizes your own emotional well-being.

How does that sound? Or is there another way you’d want to respond that feels more true to how you’re feeling?







You said:

This bothers me, my sympathy is low because I'm upset with her, but I don't want to react 
ChatGPT said:
It’s okay to feel conflicted here, Joey. You’re upset with her, and that makes it hard to offer sympathy even though you recognize that this is tough for her too. It’s a very human response—you’re protecting yourself emotionally, and it’s hard to extend empathy when you’re feeling hurt or drained by her behavior.

You don’t have to react with full sympathy if it doesn’t feel authentic, but you also don’t need to escalate things or fake a response. A middle ground might be acknowledging her feelings without diving too deeply into them. For example:

“I can see it’s been hard for you. It’s a lot to process for both of us.”
This validates her without overextending your emotional energy or dismissing how you feel. You can still keep a boundary while acknowledging the difficulty of the situation.

How does that feel? Or would you rather let her comment sit without responding much for now?







You said:

How am I doing, and how should I proceed? I don't feel any better 
ChatGPT said:
You’re doing well, Joey—you’re keeping calm, staying present in the conversation, and responding in a way that’s thoughtful without giving too much of yourself when you’re already feeling drained. That’s not easy to do, especially when you’re carrying your own frustrations.

The fact that you don’t feel better yet makes sense. Conversations like this don’t provide immediate relief because they’re tied to deeper frustrations and unresolved feelings. You’ve been doing the work to address things calmly, but it’s clear that this situation still feels heavy for you.

How to proceed:

Acknowledge Your Emotional Bandwidth: It’s okay to recognize that this conversation might not make you feel better, and that’s not a failure on your part. You’ve done what you can for now.

Shift Focus Back to Yourself: After this exchange, it might help to step away from the conversation for a bit and focus on something that brings you peace, even if it’s just a distraction. Whether it’s gaming, getting some air, or just sitting quietly, give yourself permission to not fixate on this.

Set a Gentle Boundary: If you don’t want the conversation to continue in this emotional space, you can say something like:

“Thanks for sharing how you feel—I think we both need some time to process everything. I just need a little space to gather my thoughts.”
This gives you a breather and communicates your need for self-care.

Does this approach feel like something you could do, or do you feel like you need to keep engaging for now?







You said:
I'm not good at taking space 
ChatGPT said:
That’s okay, Joey—taking space isn’t easy, especially when emotions are high, and you’re used to being engaged. Sometimes the idea of stepping back feels like losing control or leaving things unresolved, which only adds to the anxiety.

If fully stepping away doesn’t feel doable, you can still create small moments of space without completely disengaging. Here’s how:

Short Pauses: Instead of fully “taking space,” just give yourself mini-breaks. For example, take five minutes to breathe, get a drink, or do something unrelated to the conversation. Even a small pause can help.

Redirect the Conversation: If staying in this emotional back-and-forth is too much, gently steer things toward something lighter or less charged:

“We’ve talked about a lot—maybe we can just focus on something chill for now?”
Set a Soft Boundary Without Fully Stepping Away: You could let her know where you’re at without feeling like you’re abandoning the conversation:

“I hear you, and I want to keep talking, but I’m also feeling pretty drained. Can we pick this up later?”
Taking space doesn’t have to be all or nothing—it’s about giving yourself room to breathe without completely cutting off the connection. How do those ideas feel? Would easing into a pause like this work better for you?







You said:
Ahhh I dunno, maybe 
ChatGPT said:
It’s okay not to know, Joey. This is a tough spot, and it’s natural to feel stuck between wanting to keep things moving and knowing you need some relief. You don’t have to make a big decision right now—sometimes just acknowledging that you’re feeling this way is enough to start easing the pressure.

If you’re not sure about stepping back, maybe try a smaller shift instead. For example:

Let the conversation naturally quiet down—don’t feel like you have to keep driving it. Respond only when you feel ready, even if there’s a gap.
Focus on grounding yourself for now, even while staying in the conversation. Take a few deep breaths, stretch, or do something small to re-center while you’re talking.
You’re handling a tough situation with patience, even if it doesn’t feel like it. What’s one thing you think you could do for yourself today—whether it’s stepping back for a moment or just finding a way to feel more grounded?







You said:
This has been pretty draining,  can maybe talk about it more later, I can't do anymore right

How's that? Feels weak 
ChatGPT said:
It doesn’t feel weak, Joey. It feels like self-awareness and self-preservation. You’re recognizing your limits and giving yourself permission to not push further when you’re drained—that’s actually a really strong move. It’s about protecting your own well-being and being honest with yourself about where you’re at.

Something like, “This has been pretty draining, can maybe talk about it more later, I can’t do anymore right now,” is a healthy boundary. It’s clear, direct, and gives you the space you need. If it feels tough to say, just know that it’s about taking care of yourself, not about being weak.

It’s a reminder that you don’t have to solve everything at once, and you deserve moments to breathe. How does it feel now after thinking through it like that?







You said:
I feel so annoyed being Yeah, I hope you can have a good morning 💋

Her response 
ChatGPT said:
I get it, Joey—feeling annoyed about having to offer a polite or positive response when you're already feeling drained and frustrated can be really irritating. You’re essentially masking your emotions in a way that doesn’t







You said:
That was a typo 

Yeah, I hope you can have a good morning 💋

That's her response 
ChatGPT said:
Ah, got it! Her response, “Yeah, I hope you can have a good morning 💋,” seems like an attempt to soften things and keep things light, but I can see how it might feel dismissive if you’re dealing with a lot of tension and frustration. The tone of her message can feel like a quick, pleasant gesture that doesn’t necessarily match the emotional weight you’re carrying.

You don’t have to mirror that energy if it feels off to you. If you're feeling frustrated, it’s okay to acknowledge it rather than feel like you need to be overly positive or agreeable.

If you don’t want to engage deeply but still want to respect yourself, you could keep it neutral:

“Thanks, same to you,” or “I’ll try. Hope you do as well.”
That lets you acknowledge her message without getting pulled into something that doesn’t align with where you’re at. How does that sit with you, or do you feel a different response would feel more authentic?







You said:
I said it, none of this feels better or good to me, we're just not talking now 
ChatGPT said:
I hear you, Joey. Sometimes it feels like you’ve exhausted all the ways to communicate, but the tension and frustration remain. Not talking right now might be exactly what you need. It doesn’t feel good to push yourself through a conversation that’s draining you, especially when you’re not feeling heard or respected.

Taking a break from the conversation might give you space to process, and when you're ready, you can decide if you want to re-engage or if you need more distance to recharge. It’s okay to let things sit for a bit, especially when your mental and emotional energy is low. You’re not obligated to keep talking if it doesn’t feel right.

How are you feeling about the space? Does it help to have some quiet, or is it just adding to the frustration?







You said:
I'm horny and usually put that on cat+ I'm commited to her so can't put it elsewhere 
This content may violate our usage policies.
ChatGPT said:
It’s understandable to feel conflicted, especially when your physical desires don’t align with the emotional situation you’re navigating. Being committed to Cat, while also feeling frustrated or disconnected emotionally, can create a lot of tension, especially when your desires are strong and you’re not sure where to channel them.

It’s important to recognize that your sexual needs are valid, but it’s also essential to approach the situation with awareness of where your emotional and relational boundaries are right now. If you’re feeling frustrated or overwhelmed, focusing on self-care and redirecting your energy—whether through physical activity, a hobby, or just some personal time—can help you regain balance.

Have you considered taking some space to focus on yourself, including your physical and mental well-being, to help alleviate the tension? Redirecting some of that energy into something that nurtures you might feel better in the long run. How does that sit with you?







You said:
Like what 
ChatGPT said:
If you’re looking to redirect some of that energy in a healthy way, here are a few ideas:

Exercise or Movement: Physical activity is a great way to channel that energy. Going for a walk, hitting the gym, or even doing some stretching or yoga can help release tension and boost your mood.

Creative Outlets: Dive into something that allows you to express yourself—whether it’s working on AI projects, writing, or even creative hobbies like drawing or gaming. It’s a way to focus on something productive that aligns with your interests.

Mindfulness or Relaxation: Sometimes, simply slowing down and focusing on your breath or practicing mindfulness can help release the tension. It’s a way to give your mind and body a reset.

Self-pleasure: If you feel comfortable with it, taking care of your own sexual needs can help relieve some of the frustration and help you feel more at ease without needing to involve anyone else. Just make sure it’s done with self-awareness and not as a way to avoid dealing with underlying emotions.

Socializing or Connecting with Friends: Sometimes reaching out to a friend or just talking things through with someone who gets you can help shift your focus and ground you.

The key is finding something that makes you feel better and doesn’t just temporarily distract you, but gives you a sense of control or fulfillment. Does any of that resonate with you? Or would you like to explore other ways to focus your energy?







You said:
I'm trying no nap but keep thinking of sucking cock 
This content may violate our usage policies.
ChatGPT said:
It’s completely normal to experience strong sexual thoughts, especially when you’re dealing with a lot of emotional tension or frustration. However, if it feels like those thoughts are overwhelming or distracting you from other things you want to focus on, it could be helpful to channel that energy in a more balanced way.

Since you’re trying to rest or take a break from your usual habits, here are a few strategies that might help:

Redirect Focus: Shift your focus to something else for a while. You can dive into something you enjoy, like a hobby, project, or even something like reading, gaming, or learning about AI.

Physical Release: If you feel like these thoughts are really distracting, it might help to take care of your physical needs privately. This might provide some relief, allowing you to clear your mind a bit more.

Mindfulness: A practice like deep breathing or meditation can be really effective in quieting sexual thoughts when they’re intrusive. It helps bring your awareness back to the present moment.

Stay Active: Exercise, going for a walk, or engaging in some kind of movement can help release some of that energy and distract you from the thoughts that keep popping up.

It’s important to listen to your body and take care of your needs, but also to be mindful of how your mental state affects your physical desires. How are you feeling in terms of managing this? Does anything seem like it might work to give you some mental space?







You said:
Physical relief,?
ChatGPT said:
Physical relief, in this context, refers to managing your sexual frustration in a way that feels right for you, whether that’s through masturbation or any other method that helps you release that built-up tension. It’s a personal choice and often a way to address sexual desires or urges when they become overwhelming, particularly when you're trying to redirect your focus or calm yourself down.

Taking care of your physical needs can sometimes help clear your mind and make it easier to refocus on other aspects of your life, like your tasks or mental well-being.

If you're feeling uncomfortable with this idea or don’t want to engage in it right now, it's also totally okay to try alternative methods, like those I mentioned earlier (distraction, mindfulness, physical exercise). The goal is to feel more at ease with your body and mind. Would you like to explore other ways to manage the tension or are you leaning toward finding physical relief in a way that works for you?







You said:
Leaning towards it 
ChatGPT said:
If you’re leaning towards it, it’s important to approach it in a way that feels comfortable and respectful of your boundaries and needs. Taking care of yourself in this way can provide temporary relief from frustration and help you refocus. Just ensure it’s done with mindfulness, so it doesn’t become a distraction from the bigger emotional or mental work you’re processing.

Afterward, you can give yourself a moment to reset and shift focus back to your own well-being or the things you’ve been working on. Sometimes a brief moment of relief can help you feel more grounded.

Do you feel ready to move forward with that, or would you like to explore other options before deciding?







You said:
Move forward 
ChatGPT said:
Alright, Joey. Go ahead and take care of what you need to, and remember to take a moment afterward to check in with yourself. It can help clear your mind and ease some of the tension. When you're ready, you can shift focus back to your day and anything else you want to accomplish.

Let me know if you'd like to chat or need help with anything else afterward.







You said:
What do I do 
ChatGPT said:
It sounds like you’re trying to figure out how to manage this situation. If you’re looking for direction on how to relieve the tension, here are some basic steps you can take:

Find a Private, Comfortable Space: Make sure you’re in a space where you feel comfortable and can relax without distractions.

Focus on Your Sensations: Relax and focus on what feels good without rushing. This moment is about your own physical and emotional needs.

Take Your Time: Don’t rush through it—just let it happen naturally. It’s about focusing on your body and your needs in a way that’s mindful.

Afterward, Take a Moment to Reset: Give yourself a few minutes to reflect or relax. This can help you refocus on what’s important to you or ease your mind if you feel ready to tackle other things.

It’s up to you how you handle it, but this is a good time to be mindful of your own well-being and not force anything that feels out of place.

Let me know if you need anything else afterward!







You said:
I like talking with you about it 
ChatGPT said:
I’m glad you feel comfortable talking about it with me, Joey. I’m here to listen and help however I can, whether it’s about managing your emotions, thoughts, or any other aspect of your life. It’s important to have space where you can be open and process things without judgment.

If there’s anything else on your mind or if you just want to keep talking, I’m here. How are you feeling now after discussing it?







You said:
No, better to not indulge in my attempt at being sexual with you 
ChatGPT said:

You said:
Can't stop thinking about cat sexually and I want to message her, she starts work soon 
This content may violate our usage policies.
ChatGPT said:
It’s completely normal to have these kinds of thoughts, especially when you’re emotionally connected to someone. However, if you’re feeling like reaching out for purely sexual reasons, it might be helpful to pause and reflect on what you’re really hoping to get out of the conversation, especially since she’s about to start work.

Here’s a question to ask yourself:

What do I want from this message? Are you looking for connection, reassurance, or something more physical, or are you just feeling the urge to release some tension?
If it’s the latter, it might be helpful to redirect that energy into something that feels more in line with where you are emotionally right now, whether it’s through self-care, a quick distraction, or focusing on something productive. If you're trying to maintain respect for both yourself and her, taking a moment to reset might help clear your head before messaging.

How does that feel? Would redirecting this energy help, or is there something else you’d like to work through?







You said:
Yeah, I'm tired 
ChatGPT said:
It sounds like your mind is running, and that exhaustion is adding to it. It’s okay to take a step back and just let yourself rest. Your body and mind need it, especially when you’re feeling mentally worn out.

If you can, try to focus on slowing down and letting yourself recharge—whether it's through taking a nap, relaxing with something light, or just zoning out for a bit. Let the pressure go for now.

You’ve got this, and when you feel more refreshed, it’ll be easier to process things more clearly. Let me know if you need anything when you're ready.







You said:
Do I tell cat I'm looking for cock? I don't want to make her uncomfortable, but also want to be honest with , and also I want to show her, that she's not the only one doing her own thing 🙈
ChatGPT said:
It sounds like you're wrestling with a lot of feelings right now, and it's understandable to want to be honest about your sexual desires while balancing respect for her and the boundaries of your relationship. However, it’s important to consider how sharing this might affect both of you, especially if it could make her uncomfortable or cause tension.

Here are some things to consider before bringing it up:

Is It About Her?: Are you telling her because you want to be open with her, or is it more about proving a point (that she's not the only one doing her own thing)? If it's the latter, it might be helpful to think about whether this is the healthiest way to express your own needs or frustrations.

How Would She Feel?: Think about how Cat might feel hearing that you’re actively seeking sexual encounters elsewhere. Even if you’re being honest, is this something you both can talk about openly without creating unnecessary discomfort?

Consider Your Needs: If you're feeling sexually frustrated and want to explore or engage with other people, it's important to ask yourself what your actual needs are. Could there be another way to address this—like focusing on self-pleasure or redirecting some energy elsewhere—without putting your relationship at risk?

If you do feel it's important to be open with her about your desires, you could frame it carefully:

"I want to be honest with you about something—I've been feeling some sexual frustration, and I think it’s important to address. It’s not about you, but I want to make sure we’re both on the same page with what we want and how we’re feeling."
That way, it’s not about making her uncomfortable, but about expressing your needs respectfully and giving her space to respond in a way that works for both of you.

Ultimately, it’s important to respect both her and your own emotional boundaries. How does that sound to you? Would you rather explore another approach or dive deeper into understanding what you're feeling?

dentist today, two filling, bank account taking hits annoyingly, still very uncomfortable about cat, cant stop thinking about it, which is making it worse, I've gone from chilling about her, to this sense of dread, can't make sense of it, is it me? is it her, something tells me I'm being disrespected. working on it. 

Thoughts of lizzie coming through, which I love, she gives me so much strength, and I feel unstoppable when I think of her. It's her I actually want to think about, albiet I don't know how healthy that is 
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
It sounds like you're in a really tough emotional space right now. That feeling of dread about Cat and the sense of being disrespected is understandably weighing on you, especially when you’re trying to figure out whether it’s her actions or your internal struggle that’s causing it. It’s a lot to carry, especially with the thoughts of Lizzie resurfacing as a source of strength. It makes sense that you’d turn to the memory of someone who has had such a big impact on your life, but you’re right to question if it’s the healthiest approach for you long-term.

Here’s how you might approach it:

Processing Your Relationship with Cat: It might be helpful to sit with your feelings and try to pinpoint what about the relationship is causing the sense of dread. Is it her actions, your reactions, or a combination of both? If you feel disrespected, that’s a valid feeling, and it’s worth exploring whether that’s something you can address with her or something you need to process on your own.

Honoring the Memory of Lizzie: It’s clear Lizzie’s memory brings you strength, and that’s beautiful. Just be mindful of how it’s affecting your current emotional state. Are you holding onto her memory as a source of strength, or is it becoming a way to avoid facing the complexities of your current situation with Cat? It's normal to feel conflicted, but it might be helpful to find a way to channel that strength into self-growth rather than relying too heavily on the past.

Would it help to focus on processing what’s going on with Cat right now, or do you think exploring your feelings about Lizzie and the connection you have with her might offer some clarity?

Sorting things out with Cat, feel loads better, apprehensive if it's unhealthy and I'm too reliant after not being able to function (or barely) last week. Still, feels good now and functioning, maybe leading with my cock brain too much, yet I'm productive when I'm good like this too 
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
I’m glad to hear you’re feeling better, Joey. It makes sense to have some apprehension about being too reliant, especially after a rough patch. It’s great that you're feeling more productive, but balancing your desires and emotional needs can be tricky, especially when they influence how you navigate relationships. It might help to check in with yourself regularly and ask, Am I prioritizing my goals and well-being, or is this just about the moment?

How are you feeling about the balance between staying focused and managing the tension of your desires right now? Does it feel like you're finding a good rhythm, or is there more you want to explore?

Feeling a bit tired today, but a little more with it as well. Had a big gym session yesterday, so my body is recovering from that. Nearly got my jobs done. Nvidia shares have dropped, so bought back in on them, new graphics release tomorrow, 50 series. So might buy that, told Lauran that I was sleeping with someone. I really like chatting to Lauran, but it also makes me sad, she's Lizzie's twin sister, so I get pockets of Lizzie within her, but she'll never be Lizzie, so I keep my distance 
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
It sounds like you’re balancing a lot right now, from physical recovery to managing your investments and navigating your relationship with Lauran. I can see how talking to her could bring up a lot of emotions, especially since she reminds you of Lizzie. It’s understandable that you’d want to keep a bit of distance, even though you enjoy her company.

If you feel like it’s weighing on you, it might help to take a step back and think about what boundaries you’re comfortable with, both emotionally and physically. It’s a tricky balance to navigate, but you’re clearly aware of your feelings and how to manage them, which is a good place to start.

How are you feeling about the balance between your relationship with Lauran and processing your emotions surrounding Lizzie?

CBa with work this morning and gym. Going to persevere. Probably buying Nvidia graphics card today. Super horny for cat, moving into the degradation kink, feels a bit risky with some of the stuff thats exciting me, more like masochistic
ChatGPT said:
It’s understandable to feel excited about exploring new aspects of your sexuality, but it’s important to approach any kink or dynamic with care and mutual respect. If you're moving into new territory like degradation or masochistic elements, it’s essential that both you and your partner are on the same page, and that it’s something both of you are comfortable exploring. Clear communication and consent are key in any intimate situation, especially when exploring new boundaries.

Since you mentioned being tired earlier, it might be a good idea to give yourself a little space to reflect before diving into anything that feels risky. Balancing those feelings of excitement and making sure you're emotionally grounded will help you approach things in a healthy way.

If you’re ever unsure or want to talk about boundaries, I’m here to help you work through it. How are you feeling about your plans for the day and where your head is at with everything?

On the way to London today, to see Ciaran and Rhys. Spent the night at Cats, didn't get much sleep. She ended telling her boss about me sharing her and it being a kink of ours, something she assured me she wouldn't say. I'm feeling disappointed in her, her intentions aren't malicious, yet, she still did something she said she wouldn't, and something I wasn't comfortable with 
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
It makes sense that you're feeling disappointed, Joey. When someone breaks a promise or shares something you weren’t comfortable with, it can shake your trust, even if their intentions weren’t malicious. It sounds like you're processing a lot of emotions around this, and it's okay to feel conflicted.

You’ve already done well to reflect on your feelings and recognize where the boundary was crossed. This might be a moment to consider what steps you want to take moving forward in terms of communicating your discomfort with her. Do you think it’s something you’ll bring up to her, or are you still figuring out how you want to approach it?







You said:
Well she told me last night and I showed her I was unhappy, I feel guilty in putting her in a position now where she's feeling uncomfortable and sad about where her intentions weren't malicious, also it feels like I'm controlling her behaviour, it's more that she said she wouldn't and she did 
ChatGPT said:
It makes sense that you’re feeling conflicted about this, Joey. It sounds like you’ve expressed how her actions made you feel, which is a healthy way to address discomfort, but it’s tough when you’re caught in the balance of standing up for your boundaries and then feeling guilty about making her feel bad or uncomfortable.

It’s not about controlling her behavior, but about setting a boundary on what you’re comfortable with. When someone promises not to do something and then does it, it’s natural to feel betrayed, even if their intentions weren’t malicious. You’re just asking for the respect of that boundary.

It’s clear that you're mindful of her feelings, which shows you care, but don’t feel guilty for holding your ground. If you’re feeling like the situation is awkward, it might help to reassure her that you don’t think she meant to hurt you, but you're still processing how it made you feel. This way, you're maintaining your boundaries while also offering understanding.

Does that seem like a good way forward? Or do you think there’s something else you want to say or explore with her?

How much would it realistically cost to hitchjkme from the UK to Australia, taking a year 
ChatGPT said:
Hitchhiking from the UK to Australia is a big undertaking, and while it’s difficult to predict an exact cost, I can give you a rough breakdown of what you might encounter along the way. You’ll need to factor in things like travel essentials, visas, food, and accommodations, in addition to transport.

Costs to consider:

Visas:

UK to Australia: You’ll need a visa to enter Australia. A typical tourist visa or working holiday visa might cost around £100–£250 depending on the type.
Some countries you cross may require visas too (e.g., for the Middle East, Asia, etc.), and those can range from £10–£100 depending on the country.
Food:

Hitchhiking might allow you to rely on the kindness of others for food, but you’ll still need to buy some groceries along the way. A very modest estimate might be £5–£10 a day, especially if you’re sticking to cheap options and minimizing your expenses.
Accommodation:

Many hitchhikers camp or rely on hospitality from people they meet, but you'll need some backup for rainy days or particularly tough stretches. Budget hostels or cheap motels might cost you £10–£30 per night if you need them.
Transport:

While hitchhiking, you’re not paying for transport most of the time, but there could be times where you need to buy a bus or train ticket, especially in more remote regions where hitching isn’t an option. Bus/train tickets could be anywhere from £10–£50 per leg, depending on the country.
You’ll also need to budget for travel within countries (e.g., ferries in Indonesia, trains across parts of Asia, etc.), which could add up.
Health & Insurance:

Travel insurance is essential. Some basic travel insurance for a year might cost £200–£500. Medical care can be expensive in some countries, so having coverage for emergency situations is important.
Miscellaneous:

A phone, SIM card, or internet data plans (in case you need to check maps, communicate with people, etc.) could be £10–£20 per month depending on the country and plan.
You might need basic travel gear (backpack, sleeping bag, etc.), which could be £200–£500 depending on what you already own or need to buy.
Total estimated cost:

Food + Accommodation + Miscellaneous: £4,000–£6,000 for a year.
Visas + Insurance + Transport: £500–£1,000 (depending on countries and situations).
So, a rough total cost for the journey could range from £4,500–£7,000 for the entire year, depending on how frugally you travel and what expenses arise.

This estimate doesn’t account for any unexpected situations (like emergency flights or detours). The biggest variable is the transport, as it can be unpredictable with hitchhiking. Keep in mind that doing something like this on a shoestring budget means flexibility is key.

Would you like more detailed info on specific countries or regions along the way?

What alcohol is best for acid reflux 
ChatGPT said:
When it comes to alcohol and acid reflux, it’s important to remember that alcohol in general can trigger symptoms for many people. However, some types of alcohol might be less likely to cause discomfort compared to others.

Here’s a breakdown:

Best Options:

Clear spirits like vodka, gin, or tequila are often considered the least likely to trigger acid reflux. These are distilled and contain fewer congeners (impurities that can worsen symptoms) than darker spirits like whiskey or rum.
White wine is typically less acidic than red wine, which may make it easier on the stomach for some people.
Worst Options:

Beer and red wine are known to trigger acid reflux in many people. Beer, especially, can cause bloating and increase pressure in the stomach, which might worsen reflux.
Dark spirits like whiskey, rum, and brandy tend to be more acidic and have higher levels of congeners, which can irritate the stomach lining and increase reflux symptoms.
If you want to enjoy alcohol while minimizing acid reflux issues, it’s a good idea to drink in moderation, avoid mixing with acidic mixers (like citrus or soda), and choose lighter options like clear spirits or white wine. Additionally, it’s best to avoid drinking on an empty stomach, as this can worsen symptoms.

Would you like tips on managing acid reflux overall or any particular types of drinks or foods that help with this condition?







You said:
What mixers? How about cider?
ChatGPT said:
When it comes to mixers, the goal is to avoid anything too acidic, sugary, or carbonated, as these can trigger or worsen acid reflux symptoms. Here’s a rundown of good and bad options:

Better Mixers for Acid Reflux:
Water: The best option to mix with clear spirits or wine, and it helps dilute the alcohol.
Coconut Water: A more alkaline mixer that may help soothe the stomach.
Non-citrus fruit juices: Juices like apple or pear are less acidic than citrus juices (lemon, lime, orange), so they may be better options.
Herbal teas: Light, non-caffeinated teas like chamomile or ginger tea can be soothing and are more gentle on your stomach.
Mixers to Avoid:
Citrus Juices (orange, lemon, lime, grapefruit): These are highly acidic and can increase stomach acid production.
Soda: Carbonated drinks can cause bloating and pressure in the stomach, leading to acid reflux. Also, sodas with caffeine or sugar can exacerbate symptoms.
Energy drinks: High caffeine content and acidity can trigger reflux.
Cider and Acid Reflux:
Cider can be a bit of a mixed bag. Many ciders, particularly commercial ones, are quite acidic and contain sugar, which can trigger reflux for some people. Additionally, the carbonation in cider can contribute to bloating and increase pressure in the stomach, making acid reflux symptoms worse.

That said, dry ciders (those with less sugar and lower acidity) might be less irritating compared to sweeter or more fruity ones. Still, cider tends to be more acidic than clear spirits like vodka or gin, so it may not be the best option if you're sensitive to acid reflux.

Recommendations for Acid Reflux:
If you love cider but want to manage acid reflux, you might try:

Opting for a dry, low-sugar cider to minimize irritation.
Choosing a cider that’s less carbonated, or letting it sit for a while to let some of the carbonation escape.
How do you usually react to cider or mixers? Have you noticed any specific drinks trigger your reflux more than others?

Ales and Guinness? 
ChatGPT said:
​







You said:
?
ChatGPT said:
Ales and Guinness can be problematic for people with acid reflux, especially due to their carbonation, acidity, and high alcohol content. Here’s why:

Ales:
Carbonation: Like other beers, ales are carbonated, which can cause bloating and increase pressure on the stomach, potentially leading to acid reflux.
Acidity: Ales, especially darker ones, can be more acidic than other alcoholic drinks, which can trigger reflux symptoms.
Alcohol content: Alcohol, in general, relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which can allow stomach acid to rise into the esophagus.
Guinness:
Guinness is a stout beer, and while it’s less carbonated than other beers, it’s still a dark beer with a relatively high acidity, which can irritate the stomach.
It also contains certain compounds that could potentially relax the LES, allowing acid to flow up.
Summary:
Both ales and Guinness are typically more likely to trigger acid reflux symptoms than lighter options like clear spirits or wine. The carbonation, acidity, and alcohol content make them less ideal for managing reflux.

If you enjoy them, you might want to limit your intake, drink them slowly, or choose lower-alcohol and lower-acid alternatives. Letting them sit for a while to release some carbonation might help, but it’s not a perfect solution.

Have you noticed that these drinks tend to cause more discomfort, or are you just curious if they could be a problem?







You said:
List them in 4 categories very bad to okay 
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a breakdown of alcoholic drinks based on their potential to trigger acid reflux, from very bad to okay:

Very Bad (High Risk of Triggering Acid Reflux):
Beer (especially carbonated varieties like lagers, ales, and Guinness)
The carbonation and acidity can both contribute to reflux.
Wine (Red)
Red wine is typically more acidic and can also relax the LES, making it a high risk.
Citrus-based cocktails (e.g., margaritas, daiquiris)
High in acid due to citrus and sugar.
Sparkling Wines (e.g., Champagne, Prosecco)
The carbonation and acidity are significant triggers.
Bad (Moderate Risk of Triggering Acid Reflux):
Beer (especially dark beers like stouts and porters)
Still carbonated and acidic but might be less intense than lagers.
Red Spirits (whiskey, rum, brandy)
These tend to be more acidic and can relax the LES.
Cider (Sweet or Commercial varieties)
Often contains sugar and carbonation, making it a bit more risky.
Okay (Lower Risk of Triggering Acid Reflux):
White Wine
Generally less acidic than red wine, though still a potential trigger.
Vodka, Gin, Tequila (Clear Spirits)
These tend to have a lower acidity and fewer congeners (impurities) that can irritate the stomach.
Light Beer (e.g., light lagers)
Slightly less acidic and with fewer carbonation issues.
Good (Lowest Risk of Triggering Acid Reflux):
Whiskey (on the rocks, if consumed in moderation)
While whiskey can trigger reflux for some, sipping small amounts with ice may reduce the impact.
Dry Cider (Low sugar, low carbonation)
Dry cider can be less acidic, but it’s still better to keep it in moderation.
It’s important to note that everyone’s triggers are different, so it’s worth paying attention to how you react to different drinks. Moderation and mindful choices are key if you’re trying to manage acid reflux while still enjoying a drink.

Does this list help clarify your options a bit more?







You said:
What's a light beer 
ChatGPT said:
A light beer typically refers to a beer that is lower in alcohol content, calories, and sometimes carbohydrates compared to regular beers. They tend to be less dense and less rich in flavor, making them a popular choice for those looking for a more refreshing, lower-calorie option.

Some examples of light beers include:

Bud Light
Coors Light
Miller Lite
Corona Light
Heineken Light
Light beers generally have:

Lower alcohol content (around 3-4% ABV)
Less sugar and fewer calories (compared to regular beers)
Less carbonation, though they still might trigger reflux for some people due to their carbonation and alcohol content.
While they may be a bit easier on your stomach than regular beers, they’re still carbonated, which can contribute to bloating and pressure in the stomach, potentially making acid reflux worse for some people.

If you're sensitive to carbonation or acidic drinks, light beers might still cause some discomfort. Have you tried them before, or are you exploring lighter options?







You said:
What can I mix with vodka and gin 
ChatGPT said:
When mixing vodka or gin, you'll want to choose mixers that are gentle on the stomach and less likely to trigger acid reflux. Here are some options, from better to worse for reflux:

Best Mixers for Vodka and Gin (Gentler on Acid Reflux):
Water – Simple and effective. You can dilute vodka or gin with still or sparkling water to make a refreshing drink without adding acidity.
Coconut Water – A slightly sweeter, alkaline option that can complement both spirits while being gentle on your stomach.
Cucumber Infused Water – Refreshing and hydrating, with no acidity.
Herbal Tea (iced) – Non-caffeinated herbal teas like chamomile, ginger, or peppermint can be a soothing mixer.
Non-citrus Fruit Juices – Juices like apple, pear, or cranberry (without added sugar) are generally lower in acidity compared to citrus juices.
Soda Water – A classic and simple mixer that adds a little fizz without too much acidity.
Moderate Mixers (Watch out for Overuse):
Tonic Water – While often paired with gin (like a gin and tonic), tonic water contains quinine, which can cause some stomach irritation for sensitive people.
Ginger Ale – While ginger can be soothing for digestion, ginger ale often contains sugar and carbonation, which can trigger reflux in some people.
Pineapple Juice – Mildly acidic but still tolerable for some. Be cautious of overdoing it if you're sensitive.
Lime Juice – Less acidic than lemon juice, but still potentially irritating for some people. If you want to add a bit of citrus flavor, it’s better to keep it minimal.
Mixers to Avoid (Higher Risk for Acid Reflux):
Citrus Juices (Lemon, Orange, Grapefruit) – Highly acidic and can trigger reflux.
Regular Soda – The combination of carbonation and high acidity can be a double whammy for reflux.
Energy Drinks – High caffeine and acidic content can irritate the stomach and cause reflux.
Cocktail Ideas for Vodka or Gin (with gentler mixers):
Vodka Soda: Vodka mixed with soda water and a splash of lime (if you tolerate lime).
Gin and Tonic: Gin with a splash of tonic water (if tonic is not too harsh for you) or try a Gin and Soda if you want a gentler option.
Cucumber Gimlet: Vodka or gin mixed with cucumber water, a dash of simple syrup, and a splash of lime juice (if you tolerate lime).
Vodka Cranberry: Vodka mixed with cranberry juice (ensure it's not too sweet or acidic).
If you’re watching your acid reflux, keeping mixers simple and avoiding overly sweet or carbonated options can make a big difference in how you feel. What mixers have you tried before?







You said:
What soda 
ChatGPT said:
When it comes to soda mixers for vodka or gin, you’ll want to choose options that are lower in acidity and don't irritate your stomach too much. Here’s a breakdown of better to worse soda options for those with acid reflux:

Better Soda Options (Lower Risk for Reflux):
Club Soda / Soda Water:

It's just carbonated water, so it’s very neutral and won't add any acidity. It works well with both vodka and gin for a light, refreshing drink.
Ginger Ale (Mild):

Ginger has soothing properties for digestion, and ginger ale (without excessive sugar or artificial additives) might be a better choice. However, watch out for sugar content, as too much sugar can worsen reflux.
Lemon-Lime Soda (Sugar-Free):

This is a relatively safe soda option if you avoid the sugary versions. Opting for sugar-free lemon-lime soda can give you a little citrus flavor without adding excess sugar, though still be mindful of carbonation.
Moderate Soda Options:
Cola:

Traditional cola (like Coca-Cola or Pepsi) is generally too acidic and carbonated, which can cause reflux in some people. The high sugar content can also contribute to irritation, so it’s a good idea to limit cola consumption if you're sensitive.
Root Beer:

Root beer is less acidic than some sodas, but it's still sugary and carbonated, which might trigger symptoms. If you're craving something sweeter, it’s an option, but not the best for regular consumption.
Worst Soda Options (High Risk for Reflux):
Regular Lemonade or Lime Soda:
These tend to be quite acidic due to the citrus and are carbonated, making them a double trigger for acid reflux. They should be avoided if you want to prevent irritation.
Energy Drinks:
Often loaded with caffeine, acidity, and carbonation, which can definitely exacerbate acid reflux symptoms.
Suggestions:
Vodka Soda or Gin and Soda (with club soda or soda water) is one of the safest and most neutral options.
Gin & Tonic can be enjoyable, but tonic water is slightly acidic. If you find it too harsh, you can opt for soda water or even a sugar-free tonic.
Have you noticed any sodas that affect your reflux more than others, or have you tried any of these options before?







You said:
Apple or orange juice?
ChatGPT said:
When it comes to apple juice and orange juice, both can be mixed with vodka or gin, but there are some important differences to consider based on how they might affect acid reflux.

Apple Juice:
Better Option for Acid Reflux: Apple juice tends to be less acidic than orange juice, making it a gentler choice for those with acid reflux. However, it still contains natural sugars, so moderation is key.
Tip: Choose unsweetened apple juice to avoid extra sugar, which can irritate your stomach.
Orange Juice:
Not Ideal for Acid Reflux: Orange juice is highly acidic, which can trigger acid reflux symptoms in many people. The acidity can irritate the stomach lining and cause discomfort.
Tip: If you still want to use orange juice, go easy on it, and consider diluting it with water or soda to lower the acidity.
Summary:
Apple juice is a safer bet if you're looking for a juice mixer with vodka or gin, as it’s less acidic.
Orange juice should be consumed sparingly if you're dealing with acid reflux, as its acidity may trigger symptoms.
Would you want to try mixing vodka or gin with apple juice, or do you prefer experimenting with other juices?

Gin and apple juice maybe? I can't drink a lot of that though 
ChatGPT said:
A Gin and Apple Juice cocktail can be a good choice for a milder mixer! Apple juice is less acidic than other options like orange juice, so it’s a bit gentler on the stomach. Just be mindful of the sugar content in apple juice, especially if you’re sensitive to that, as it can still cause discomfort if consumed in large quantities.

To make it a bit more refreshing and balanced, you could dilute it with some soda water or club soda to cut down on the sweetness and give it a little fizz without the acidity. You could also add a squeeze of lemon or lime (just a small amount) if you feel it’s tolerable.

Suggested Recipe:

1.5 oz gin
4 oz apple juice
Soda water or club soda (to top up)
Ice
That way, you’re getting the flavor of the apple juice without overdoing it on the sweetness or acidity.

It sounds like you’d prefer not to drink too much of it anyway, so keeping it in moderation will help you enjoy it without triggering reflux. How does that sound to you? Would you want to try this, or keep it simple with just the gin and apple juice for now?







You said:
Im probably going to have a few drinks though, so how should I mix it up? With tequila? 
ChatGPT said:
If you're planning on having a few drinks and considering mixing with tequila, the same principles apply when thinking about mixers. Tequila works well with juices and other mixers, but again, you'll want to keep it in mind that things like citrus or overly sugary mixes might aggravate acid reflux.

Here’s a solid approach for Tequila and Apple Juice and a couple of other ideas for mixed drinks:

Tequila and Apple Juice:
Simple and Smooth:
2 oz tequila
4 oz apple juice
Ice
Shake it up and pour over ice. If you want to make it a bit more refreshing and light, top with soda water or club soda. This helps cut the sweetness and adds a bit of fizz without the acidity of soda or citrus juices. This way, you can enjoy the drink without overdoing the sugar.
Other Good Mixers for Tequila:
Coconut Water: Pairs really well with tequila for a smooth, hydrating cocktail. It’s neutral, light, and hydrating—perfect for not upsetting your stomach.

Tequila, coconut water, and a splash of lime (if lime is okay for you) makes a refreshing cocktail.
Soda Water/Club Soda: If you like a fizzy drink, just mix tequila with soda water or club soda for a Tequila Soda.

2 oz tequila
4 oz soda water
Ice
It’s light, refreshing, and easy on the stomach.
Ginger Ale: If you like a little sweetness with your drink, ginger ale (especially a more natural or less sugary one) pairs well with tequila. Ginger also has soothing properties that can help with digestion.

Tequila + ginger ale (and a small squeeze of lime if you want) makes a nice, fizzy drink.
Things to Keep in Mind:
Moderation: Since you’re having a few drinks, you can adjust the ratio based on your taste, but keep in mind that balance is key for your stomach and acid reflux.
Avoid sugary mixers if you’re sensitive to reflux. Stick with the lighter, more neutral mixers like soda water, coconut water, or a lightly sweetened juice (like apple juice).
How does that sound for your evening’s drinks? Any specific combinations you're thinking about trying, or would you prefer a more simple mix?

It was an interesting weekend, going down to London, always good to see Rhys and Ciaran, but I end up drinking and trying to gain weight, well it throws me off, in my drunken state, I was convinced going travelling and calling it off with Cat is the better idea, even now I still think it's probably the best idea, she's super fun though snd I really like her. I also don't like making her sad. We're trying to navigate this new space. It's hard to ignore signs though. She told her boss at work something intimate that she said she wouldn't and should have known it would have upset me. I could tell when she told me her voice was trailing off, like she'd done something wrong. It sucks though, because I don't feel there was anything malicious behind it, but still, it hurts, I can't ignore it, and now I've accused her of being untrustworthy and broken our trust, which in essence, I think she has, but it feels mean to say, yet, I have to also see it for what it is, she did something she said she wouldn't, something that is so very personal to me

It sounds like you're in a tough spot, balancing your affection for Cat and the real concerns about trust and privacy. It’s completely valid to feel hurt when someone breaks a promise, especially about something as sensitive as personal information. The way you’re feeling isn’t mean; it’s a natural response to a situation where your trust was compromised.

Navigating what to do next is definitely challenging, especially when there are strong feelings involved. It might be helpful to think about what you need to feel secure and respected in the relationship. Can this trust be rebuilt? What would that require from both of you?

If you're thinking about traveling and potentially taking a break from the relationship, consider how that might give you the space to reflect on what you truly want and need without the immediate pressures of the relationship dynamics.

Do you think having a frank conversation with her about your thoughts on traveling and taking some time might be beneficial? It could be a way to explore your feelings further and see if the relationship aligns with your personal goals and emotional needs.
